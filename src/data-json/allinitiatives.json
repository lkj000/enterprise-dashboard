This solution aims to alleviate the burden on healthcare providers and empower patients, especially those with limited digital access. By employing advanced natural language processing, the AI can understand and respond to users scheduling needs, offering a seamless and user friendly experience. This technology not only streamlines the appointment process but also contributes to the broader goal of increasing vaccination rates and promoting public health. Enable outbound phone calls for notifying patients about vaccine availability adds a proactive dimension to healthcare outreach. By leveraging this capability, the system can efficiently inform individuals when vaccines become accessible, ensuring timely updates and increasing vaccination awareness. This approach fosters a more inclusive and responsive healthcare system, reaching out to patients who might not actively seek information. Experiment with a natural language Ai to assist with transfer phone calls, on average our stores have to manually call on 400K inbound transfers each year, shifting this to an automated process for associate.

When we check on myACI cloud progression grade ladder window progression rules tab, the effective date is existing but with blank RULE NAME screenshot attached . As of this moment, we can only pull the report all history with progression rule information. The current report does not include dates with blank progression rule.

      "description": " 1. User Story As a... I want to... So that... As a Business User, Marketer, or Marketing Operations User, I want to use natural language prompts to describe and generate customer journeys and audience segments within Growthloop CDP, powered by MARVE Generative AI, So that I can significantly reduce the time and technical expertise required to create targeted campaigns, iterate faster, and unlock more sophisticated personalization strategies. 2. Problem Statement: Currently, creating complex customer journeys and nuanced audience segments in Growthloop CDP is a manual, time consuming process that often requires deep technical understanding of the platform s rule builder and data model. This can be a bottleneck for marketers, slowing down campaign ideation and execution, and limiting the ability to quickly test new hypotheses. Non technical users may find it challenging to leverage the full power of the CDP. 3. Proposed Solution: Integrate MARVE Generative AI into Growthloop CDP to provide a new interface where users can describe their desired customer journeys and audience segments using natural language. MARVE will interpret these descriptions and automatically generate the corresponding configurations rules, steps, conditions, etc. within Growthloop, ready for review, refinement, and activation. This involves: Developing an interface for users to input natural language prompts. Integrating with MARVE Generative AI API. MARVE s NLP engine processing the input and understanding user intent. MARVE generating structured journey audience definitions compatible with Growthloop s architecture. Presenting the generated journey audience to the user for review and editing within the existing Growthloop UI. Ensuring MARVE is aware of the Growthloop data schema attributes, events, etc. to accurately map user intent. 4. Key Capabilities Features: NLP Input Interface: A dedicated area e.g., a text box or modal within Growthloop for users to type their journey or audience descriptions in plain English. Audience Generation via NLP: Ability to define audience criteria based on attributes, events, behaviors, and their combinations using natural language e.g., Users who live in New York, purchased product X in the last 30 days, and opened our last newsletter . MARVE translates this into Growthloop specific segmentation rules. Journey Generation via NLP: Ability to outline journey steps, triggers, conditions, delays, and actions using natural language e.g., When a user signs up, send them a welcome email. If they click a link in the email, add them to the engaged segment. If not, after 3 days, send a follow up email with a special offer. . MARVE translates this into a Growthloop journey flow. Review and Edit Mechanism: Users can view the MARVE generated audience rules or journey flow in the standard Growthloop interface and make manual adjustments before saving or activating. Contextual Awareness Data Schema : MARVE needs to be aware of available customer attributes, events, and segment names within the specific Growthloop instance to accurately interpret prompts. Disambiguation Clarification Stretch Goal for MVP : If a prompt is ambiguous, MARVE ideally should ask clarifying questions or present potential interpretations. 5. Acceptance Criteria AC : General: AC1: The MARVE AI integration is secure and complies with data privacy policies. AC2: The new NLP input interface is intuitive and clearly discoverable within Growthloop CDP. AC3: MARVE s responses and generations are reasonably fast e.g., within X seconds for typical queries . AC4: Clear error handling and user guidance are provided if MARVE cannot understand a prompt or if an error occurs during generation. Audience Generation: AC5: Given a Growth Marketer, when they input a clear natural language description for an audience e.g., Customers who made a purchase over 100 in the last 60 days and live in California , then MARVE accurately generates the corresponding segment rules in Growthloop, ready for review. AC6: Given a generated audience, when the user reviews it, then they can modify the rules using the existing Growthloop segmentation UI and save it. AC7: MARVE correctly interprets common operators AND, OR, NOT , date ranges, numerical comparisons, and string matches for attributes. Journey Generation: AC8: Given a Growth Marketer, when they input a clear natural language description for a multi step journey e.g., On user registration, send welcome email. Wait 2 days. If no purchase, send offer email. If purchase, add to VIP segment. , then MARVE accurately generates the corresponding journey flow with triggers, actions, delays, and conditions in Growthloop, ready for review. AC9: Given a generated journey, when the user reviews it, then they can modify steps, conditions, and actions using the existing Growthloop journey builder UI and save it. AC10: MARVE can generate journeys based on triggers e.g., when a user abandons cart , actions e.g., send email X, add to list Y , conditions e.g., if user is in segment Z , and delays e.g., wait 3 days . Adoption Usability: AC11: Documentation and in app guidance are available for using the MARVE NLP feature. AC12: Users are able to successfully create and activate at least one audience and one journey using the MARVE feature during UAT. 6. Out of Scope for this initial feature MVP : Full conversational, back and forth dialogue with MARVE beyond simple clarifications if implemented . MARVE generating creative content e.g., email copy, SMS text . This feature focuses on structural generation. Proactive suggestions from MARVE without user prompts. Automatic optimization of MARVE generated or any journeys audiences based on performance data. MARVE learning and adapting its generation style based on individual user feedback beyond global model improvements . 7. Dependencies: Stable and documented MARVE Generative AI API. Access to and understanding of Growthloop CDP s internal data model and API for creating modifying audiences and journeys. Infrastructure to host manage the interaction with MARVE if not fully cloud based . Clear definition of customer attributes and events within Growthloop that MARVE needs to be aware of. 8. Success Metrics How we ll measure impact : Adoption Rate: of active Growthloop users utilizing the MARVE NLP feature within X months post launch. Time to Create: Reduction in average time taken to create a new audience or journey compared to the manual method. Volume of Creation: Number of audiences and journeys created via MARVE. User Satisfaction: CSAT NPS scores from users specifically surveyed about this feature. Error Rate Refinement Needed: Percentage of MARVE generated items that require significant manual correction vs. minor tweaks or direct use. Increased Campaign Velocity: Number of new campaigns tests launched that leverage MARVE generated assets.",

Currently Available : Nothing. We just have BPNs for set amount but lot of work is needed to mobilize this. Potential solution : Round up the total option at checkout Requirement : Customer will be presented an option checkbox to round up their order total similar to gifting Round up for charity subtext Donate 0.35 to nourishing neighbors to fight against hunger If they choose to round up, we use the exact amount stated at the time of order placement as the donation amount even if the order total later changes due to reasons like oos, substitutions etc. Order edit will be out of scope. There will not be any option to change donation amount, or donate at the time of editing the order This is ONLY applicable for B2C orders Assumptions: We will create a Standard Donation PLU with variable price option similar to driver tipping This does not need to go to accupick Donations will be refundable similar to driver tipping Order payload will have this as one more line item when it sends out the information so it can be handled downstream like driver tipping . Nourishing neighbors will be the same name across all banners. Small 1 4 sprints Medium: 4 8 Large 8 16: XL 16 Only orders that are fully paid via CC, apple pay, paypal, and banner cash will have this enabled. This will be restricted from UI at the cart and checkout itself This will show up on receipt This will also show up on all order communications ",

      "description": "h3. Original: Background Today, customers struggle to efficiently navigate our product catalog due to a rigid taxonomy that limits products to single categories, making it difficult to find what they need. To address this, we will develop a flexible taxonomy that supports multi homing, allowing products to be categorized under multiple relevant categories. By leveraging AI for evaluation and creating self service tools for stakeholders, we expect to enhance product discoverability and streamline the shopping experience, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and driving sales. Expected to drive 25 50M in incremental sales. Problem statement: Our taxonomy is confusing difficult to navigate, which can impact the customer experience in several ways: Difficulty finding products: Our current taxonomy system presents challenges that impede our ability to efficiently categorize and manage products. When categories are not logically organized, customers may struggle to find the products they are looking for. Poor User Experience: A cluttered or confusing navigation structure can make the shopping experience cumbersome, reducing the likelihood of customers returning to the site Reduced Search Efficiency: Ineffective taxonomy can hinder the site s search functionality, making it harder for customers to get relevant search results quickly. Lower Conversion Rates: If customers cannot easily find what they need, they are less likely to make a purchase, which can negatively impact sales and conversion rates. Opportunity: The lack of multi homing capabilities restrict products to a single category. This limitation affects both 1P and marketplace products, leading to inefficiencies in product discovery and a suboptimal search and browse experience. Managing taxonomy changes currently depends on catalog operations teams. Stakeholders lack the tools to make necessary adjustments independently, which slows down our response to market needs. Taxonomy shelf URLs are generated only when a product is available in a default store. If a product is not in a default store, the Taxonomy URL is not assigned to the new taxonomy in the left navigation. Consequently, the product can only be found through search, not via the left navigation. As a customer, I can efficiently find products under multiple categories. As a user of Catalog UI, I am able to create new nodes and self serve on new taxonomy needed for events occassions",

      "description": " opportunity Build a contextual widget to collect explicit customer information preferences, interests, and identity , and that is easy plugin across pages ex: celebration page and configurable by info we need ex: birthday . The information collected feeds into an evolved account dashboard, Me space, that lets customers confidently and securely manage their relationship with ACI, and activates personalization, monetization, and loyalty across the experiences. The Me space lets households control and maximize their membership with Albertsons. Concurrently, we ll expand security measures within our platform by enabling passkeys, MFA and new forms of verification for sign in and specific actions ex: add a new delivery address Our scope: In FY24, Identity new registration flow, self service tools, and profile completion with reward incentives resulted in addition of 2.9M vs 2.3M FY24 target customers with both email phone info on base of 25M, 1.4M reachable vs 1.05M FY24 target on base of 28M, 0.18M full names and 0.57M birthdays. This identity completion for birthday increased the reachability of personalization experiment that resulted in 0.17 in revenue, 4.14 clip and 4.54 in b day coupon redemption rate. The FY24 areas focused on redesigning our registration flow to enable customer self service more pieces of info both email phone, name , progressive profile to ask additional pieces of info ex: diets, birthdays, address etc. , and self service tools for householding add, remove members, manage subscriptions in a new utilitarian member tab. Though our efforts reaped positive business benefits and customer benefits, we learned that to further scale these efforts for identity collection, we need to be contextual, create components that are easy to plug in integrate across pages, and dynamic to collect missing profile attributes to know our customers at a deeper level. At the core, we need to evolve our static account dashboard to translate into a Me space that brings the customer to the center of everything serving as a launchpad to manage preferences, subscriptions, favorite recipes, and pick up where they left off. Moreover, our platforms continue to face challenges on Account Takeover 1000 known cases in FY24 bot attacks which needs our security to be further strengthened across all levels. In FY25, we will approach the above in the following manner: Build a platform with contextual easy plug in widgets that collects explicit customer preferences diet, interest occasions, etc., Create a ME platform that has unified, centralized and secure access to all preferences, tools and settings. For ex: dietary. preferences across grocery, meals and health would be centralized in account through C360 Enhance security verification methods with MFA and build robust infrastructure for vendor platforms. Strengthen platform security to identify recycled phone numbers 500K month and validate customer information periodically.

We are looking to migrate the data from Azure Snowflake to GCP Google Cloud Platform . In this new platform the intent is to have more reliable data management tools Future State in place and move away from Access. Current state Access requires constant updating to its existing macros for reporting and queries and has been known to break from time to time. This causes delays in our daily process because someone needs to trace the error and then repair it. This also gives us a chance to move and consolidate all data off local computers and network drives. where we lost most of our data earlier this year, with no tracking to know how it happened There is currently a desktop being used for automation that will probably be eliminated when this task has been completed. The desktop local machines in use represent a high risk point of failure. Moving the data and functionality to the cloud should highly reduce if not eliminate the risk of failure, and potential waste of employee work effort hours when there are issues. Current work effort is collaborating with internal and contracted resources to capture and verify what the current state is and document it as best we can. Next steps will need to be a process to identify what the future state will be and what tools Software, Power BI, etc. will be utilized. Another intent of the future state will be to identify what processes and activities can be safely automated.",

      "description": "h1. Introduction and Background Sincerely Health launched to Albertsons customers in February 2023 with 1.45M registered customers to date Aug 15, 24 . Despite strong initial customer acquisition, the majority of platform engagement centers on Digital Pharmacy 67 of customers and only 33 of customers engaging with health and wellness related features. Through FY23, SH platform engagement MAU was 40 , signaling opportunities to increase engagement across key platform segments and features. Health Score Wheel of Life 85 of customers completed the survey . Only 2 of customers engage with health score after completing the survey. Health Goals 36 of customers created at least one goal and 50 of goals are completed. News Offers Only 8 engaged with news and offers. Notifications Only 6 engaged with notifications Connected devices 41 of customers have connected a tracker. Today, a deeply engaged Sincerely Health customer receives an experience similar to a minimally engaged customer. The static nature of the current health homepage does not promote or encourage customers to discover and engage with new features or tie customer journeys together in logical and intuitive ways.Customers must self navigate and discover content with only occasional prompts, alerts, or nudges resulting in an experience that is disconnected. As more digital tools, features, and external partners are integrated into the Sincerely Health ecosystem, we have an obligation to support broader and deeper platform engagement amongst new and existing customers so they may optimize the full value of Sincerely Health. Goal The Sincerely Health homepage is a welcoming point for new customers and a starting point for returning customers to resume their health journeys. Our strategy for the homepage is to intuitively guide customers on their journey to better health by delivering a concierge experience that evolves with every touchpoint through dynamic understanding of a customer s interests, behaviors, and motivations . We believe the Health Homepage is the guiding path to help the customer simplify their health journey through simple insights, actions, and next steps . The goal with the new homepage is to increase and drive routine customer engagement defined as weekly and monthly active usage across each of Sincerely Health s core pillars 1 Nutrition 2 Activity 3 Wellness 4 Rewards. Acceptance: We need to ensure the data is enabled for Data science team to accomplish next best action in Data bricks HDL being the single source of truth https: confluence.safeway.com x VDT0F ",

Early investigation shows that up to 40 of our rich attributes can be completed from this information. 2. Upload capabilities. We will work with our suppliers i.e. P G, Pepsi by supplying them the rich attributes for a Shelf. When they provide the data, Catalog Operations will upload data into Catalog. This feature will also allow us to correct any errors that are found. 3. Need to develop Native Android App with WebView. AcuPick team is removing access to browsers on device.

      "description": "In this evolving post MLP digital expereince of third part seller marketplace eco system, customers often face challenges in discovering and learning about products offered by sellers. This is primarily due to the lack of dedicated product display pages that provide comprehensive information about these products. The problem is further compounded when customers seek to find relevant complementary products to enhance their purchase experience. Our solution to this problem is the creation of specific wall garden Product display pages for Marketplace. These pages will serve as a dedicated platform for each product, providing customers with detailed information about the product, its features, benefits, and usage. This will not only enhance the customer s understanding of the product but also foster a sense of trust and confidence in the product and the third party sellers. Additionally, these Product display pages PDPs will also feature relevant complementary products. This feature will enable customers to discover products that enhance the value and utility of their primary purchase. For instance, a customer looking at a grocery chopping board might find recommendations for knives, storage containers, or salad serving bowls. This not only enriches the customer s shopping experience but also increases the chances of additional sales for the third party sellers ACI. In essence, the creation of these wall garden Product display pages PDPs in our ACI Marketplace will solve two significant customer problems. First, it will enhance product discovery and knowledge, enabling customers to make informed purchase decisions. Second, it will facilitate the discovery of relevant complementary products, enhancing the overall value of their purchase. ",

In order to create this platform service, ACI needs to create a seamless digital solution that enables customers across the US to order groceries online and have them shipped directly to their homes via third party sellers, while providing customers the information about their shipping schedules and carriers e.g.: the package be shipped via UPS will arrive at your doorstep on 4 1 2024, your package is shipped out or delayed, etc. . The solution will cover the entire process, from enabling customers to browse a new catalog of products that are available for Shipping including but not limited to selection management including pricing, inventory, deals, traffic management etc. , allow customers to place orders for nationwide shipping allow order management by sellers , while ensuring a positive user customer experience by integrating into Third party logistics 3PL service providers for seamless logistics shipping information e.g.: UPS, USPS, FedEx .

Market landscape: all major image competitor perspective, including Walmart, Target, Kroger, Amazon offer this seamless shipping as a fulfilment channel as a differentiator to their customers. During recent surveys of ACI customers, we have heard from customers that they are exploring similar services as well.

Shipping as a channel asset enables ACI customers to clearly see all available fulfillment options including shipping, thus communicating 300K additional products available outside of store catalog and gives customers a choice to receive items from broader catalog directly to their doors. This additional flexibility enhances overall Customer expereince and drives Customer acquisition and retention of customers whose needs are met uniquely by shipping. ",

Background and Problem Statement: ACI stores today sell about 1B per year in floral assortment to in store customers. ACI eCom Floral business is below 10M per year and thus not in relative parity with in store business. Main reasons for the this disparity is high out of stock rate about 50 and not presenting the in store in stock assortment to eCom customers. High out of stock rate creates negative customer experience and will result in customers not trusting ACI for ordering floral assortment via eCom. Also some of the floral assortment color variations are sold using the same UPC code, thus limiting our ability to track the correct inventory count for different colors. Asset: We will be building new asset for Floral assort selection and Inventory management to address the above problem statement. Floral business needs a new inventory management system for in store florists to mark assortment in and out stock at UPC level and also for color variations enabling updates in Web App in near real time.

Thanksgiving, Troy s birthday party, Weekly Grocery Shop, Monthly staples shop are just some of the possibilities. We will build the functionality for customers to create, save and manage multiple lists at one time. Features: 2.1 Build the capability to group products and deals into specialized lists e.g. BIA, clipped, watch list, expiring soon . 2.2 Build a capability to have multiple lists so that customers can create templates for different events. 2.3 Build the capability to share a list with another customer ID to add and edit items. Business Benefit: By helping customers manage their lists across a longer time horizon Thanksgiving list used this year to serve as a template for next year , we save them time from recreating the same list from scratch. As they add more lists that can serve as templates, ACI will be positioned as their starting point for all future planning. Est.

These recipes are created on static page templates with no allowance for customization or smart placement throughout our digital ecosystem. Proposed asset is a Publishing House which will replatform Enterprise Shoppable Content Platform, creating three key areas of functionality that allow us to meet evolving business needs that are currently limited by the exisiting system: Digital Merchandiser, an Integrater into the Ad Tech Collective Digital Bidding Platform and the ability for internal teams to self serve. 1 Self Service: We need to build new user Interfaces within Enterprise Shoppable Content Platform to enable self serve for new business stakeholders, including CPGs. We also need to build backend systems to combine data from the complex business logic entered into the UIs, with data pulled from external sources, including from our integrator with the Ad Tech Collective Digital Bidding Platform. 2 The Integrator Bidding unlocks Paid Sponsored i.e., Collective Shoppable Recipes to be placed throughout the digital customer experience. This includes an integration with the Collective s Digital Ad Tech platform to allow runtime ad bids for specific boosted placements. We ve depricated the legacy recipe publishing pipeline. As a result, we re no longer able to publish CPG sponsored recipe content. 3 Digital Merchandiser will allow us to move beyond static layouts and provide tailored logic to customize both layout and functionality on key pages scenes. This is necessary to provide a dynamic and contextual experience regardless of it being Sponsored, Division Specific or Nationally merchandized.",

Today our members can use their earned points for free grocery items, gas discounts and or cash off. The loyalty strategy for 2024 includes launching point redemption offerings that will incentivize our members to shop more with us and across channels. We will begin offering Points for Services . With this new product offering, members will be able to use their points to pay for Delivery, Flash Delivery, Flash Pickup or the minimum order fee. In addition to services, members will also be able to donate their points to local charities. To ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for our members, we will create a distinct user interface within our App. This interface will effectively differentiate between core grocery gas cash offerings and the new Services and Donations features.

Today, we already serve thousands of businesses through our current eCommerce properties, who will deliver 15M in FY 2022. These businesses purchase beverages, produce, fresh meals and pantry items as a perk for office employees, to restock their kitchens to serve meals to residents and guests, and to serve the community by sending groceries to at risk members in the community. By creating a scalable solution, we aspire to build a 500M B2B ecommerce business for Albertsons in the next 5 years for which we are seeking approval for 4M in CAPEX and 1.4M in OPEX in FY23.",

Enable customers to conveniently shop online with EBT with elevated CX journeys in discoverability of eligible products, increasing awareness of EBT as a payment method and re engaging EBT customers to shop often. Lifting online EBT sales penetration from 5.6 to 7.4 by end of FY23, be at par with in store penetration with 10.9 by FY24 and aspire to get to 13 by FY25 and increase the repeat rate for the EBT customers Customer Needs: Expand our community based goals by enabling customers with low income and mobility challenges to seamlessly shop and purchase EBT eligible items at Albertsons. Help them discover EBT payment option, items eligible and savings for the same to bring affordability and convenience of shopping online together see EBT shopper segmentation in appendix, slide 43 . Identified gaps from competitive analysis: To become industry leaders in SNAP EBT online experience, we need to close gaps in discoverability of eligible products, market the acceptance of EBT payment method on our digital channels and improve our help center to educate on SNAP EBT offerings with ACI. Additionally, streamlining checkout process, making it easy for customers to manage EBT payment card balance and enhance the post purchasing journey by highlighting EBT items, charge allocations in order details online receipts. Roadmap to close the gaps: We will optimize customer experience for web app across the known gaps, by providing targeted journeys to EBT households to aid discovery, shopping and re purchase of eligible products across all shopping funnels. We will be on par with industry baseline experience by Q3 FY23 across all the customer shopping journeys. With additional discovery and awareness, we anticipate a growth in EBT customer base across households. Business benefits: With the customer experience enhancements planned to close the gap in discovery, awareness and optimizing purchasing journeys, we aim to accelerate EBT online sales penetration from 5.6 to 7.4 by FY23, be on par with in store peaks with 10.9 by FY24 and aspire to get to 13 by FY25. We also expect to increase the repeat rate for EBT customers will work with customer analytics team to set the right target goal as next steps Risks Assumptions: The sales penetration goal does not account for reduction in EBT fund allocation. Per government announcements EBT funds are reduced by 3 for households bringing it to pre pandemic level. We are keeping an eye out on current EBT customer spend with reduced funding, and we will re evaluate our goals at the end of FY23 to assess the impact and adjust accordingly with changing trends. This plan assumes a funding of 1.7M per year for the team to work on the identified roadmap in FY23 and the following fiscal years. ",

      "description": " Background: Today, eDeals are getting published to Apex which is feeding WIMS and Vendor Deal BoD for EDM and CABS to consume. Unified Promotions Platform will be a best in class promotional platform creating a seamless user experience across our Merchants, Vendors from planning, forecasting, and detailing to executing promotions across store and ecommerce channels. UPP will consolidate capabilities across promotional process by implementing a single task based user workflow that encompass functionality within dozen plus promotional systems by end of FY22. Objective of this change is to decommission APEX and feed deals and allowance directly from MEUPP. Allowence API to be published from MEUPP to be consumed by EDM Problem Statement: While we are still able to provide promotional offers to the guest, the time consumed from merchandising teams in making the systems work together is arduous and inefficient. Creating an in house unified platform will allow users to use one succinct interface to make decisions that will make promotional planning and execution with vendors seamless. When is this needed: Priority End of Q2 2023 Business Value ROI : Revenue generation LPM Score if it is a business initiative. 43 1. Reduce efforts spent by our merchants 500 and Vendors on promotional activities by at least 20 by consolidating capabilities across Periscope, eDeals, APEX and CMS that removes double keying and quality checks of data that consume majority of department specialists time effort e.g., incorrect items, incorrect dates, missing promotion IDs etc. 2. Cost reduction in use of vendor tools e.g., 2.1M with McKinsey Vendor portal and 1.2M with eDeals etc. as we consolidate the experiences and capabilities 3. Increase effectivity of our trade desk performance across divisions by introducing capabilities that are system managed guardrails of division promotions and allowances. Actual margin or desk improvements metrics are TBD. 4. Increase Net Promoter Score NPS of tools and processes observed across 300 users from 25 to 25 Is it Compliance Legal requirement if no impact No Data Producers: UPP Unified Promotion Platform Data Consumers: EDM, WIMS and CABS Data Volume: History: N A Frequency: Sample Files Data Attributes: Monitoring requirements: Primary Key: Data Quality requirements: Acceptance Criteria: UAT: Smarish Babu MEUPP Mirela D.

One of the biggest reasons that they don t continue shopping e comm is, 1 Out of stock OOS at fulfillment is 14 and 2 irrelevant subs. 46 of customers reported they received irrelevant substitutions. The primary reason for this is customers are unable to select their substitute backup product in the UI web app as we don t surface any messaging for items that are most likely to go out of stock or already out of stock. Getting our low inventory likelihood to be OOS subs experience is pivotal for customer retention and loyalty. Vision : we receive sub selection directly from customer Scope for pilot : One division Time frame for pilot : 3 months Requirements We are able to predict items that have a higher likelihood of going out of stock in our e comm stores. We are able to surface low inventory messaging in the customer journey so that our customers are able to select a substitute product ahead of fulfillment. Today, we have subs associated with all products without any logic We don t want to incorrectly prompt nudge the customer multiple times in the customer journey resulting in frustration and a loss of trust in our brand and in our inventory prediction. Low inventory prediction model takes into consideration the supply, demand, historical availability, or lack of availability of products by category, time of the day, delivery method, picker availability, seasonality, and sales forecasts et al before marking an item as low in stock OSS Low in stock OOS is as close as possible not specific enough to real time inventory or xhours of lag max depending on fulfillment method Consistent low in stock OOS items across e comm and physical store Low inventory OOS flag consumed by catalog and info shared with smart subs API so that appropriate messages can be shared with the customer at critical customer journeys KPIs Irrelevant Not relevant subs customer satisfaction decrease Avg order size increase or decrease will have to be tested No subs not sure how this will trend Picker compliance NPS Refunds Confluence Page : https: confluence.safeway.com display CDT Low inventory updated req ",

      "description": " Goal: Create an adaptable, universal account hub that empowers our customers to connect and control all parts of their personalized shopping journey including savings, deals and healthy living. In order to successfully support SHX OKRs and goals across all the business pillars for FY2023, the customer account will evolve quickly to incorporate new functionality, services, engagement platforms and personalization. Ultimately, we will have a deeper understanding of our customers that will enable us to serve them better Customer benefit ACI customers will be now able to connect their currently fragmented membership, rewards, and shopping journeys with the consolidated Account Management Hub. The Account hub will act as a single source of truth for our customers, empowering them to manage their own personal information, settings, and preferences in a few easy taps. Customers can also secure their wallet, health, and identity information in a familiar way using biometrics ex: FaceID . With an elevated account experience, our customers will have the flexibility to update and manage information most important to them, in their preferred channel of engagement, and still have the most personalized experience anywhere they choose to engage with us. When customers access their Account hub, they will be greeted with a contextual dashboard that lets them easily pick up their shopping journey where they left off and stay up to date with their evolving shopping needs. Customer Journey Mina, a single mother with a full time job needs help with her family s weekly groceries and meals. To shop smarter, Mina has her weekly items on repeat. She gets a reminder, repeat order is confirmed and is set to arrive tomorrow. She taps to open her Albertsons app and sees a snapshot of her upcoming order on her account dashboard. On the dashboard, she has an alert that she received 25 back in Albertsons cash that can be used towards her next purchase. At a glance, she can see where she left off shopping last time under her recently viewed section. She also sees some recipes from her saved for later list right under her dashboard. She picks up shopping recipes where she left off. With her payments securely integrated into her wallet, Mina s 25 in Albertsons cash is automatically applied, and she completes her transaction in one tap. Post purchase, she can view her rewards and points earned with this order on her Account dashboard. Patricia, a former regular shopper, opens her Albertsons app for the first time in a while. She recently moved and is closer to an Albertsons store now. As she is a returning shopper, she s welcomed back to the experience with familiarity. She sees vegetarian friendly items across the app as she has already told us about her dietary preference in one of her previous sessions. As she is clipping her first deal, she is alerted that her profile is incomplete, and she can earn a reward by completing it. She taps the alert to access her account where she can see her previous purchases, preferences, available rewards, and new features. She connects her apple wallet and health app in a couple of taps securely with FaceID. Her health and dietary information is imported into her account. She sees a message that low sugar and 3 other preferences have been added. Patricia is now able to shop for low sugar, vegetarian friendly items, recipes, and recommendations easily due to her preferences. She wants to add her partner so they can shop and plan a healthier lifestyle together. She adds her partner via SMS to her account and shares her current shopping cart. .

      "description": " Goal: Make Albertsons purchasing journey so simple, efficient, and secure that all our customers want to shop online every week Customer benefit Albertsons makes it so quick and simple for me to get my groceries for my family with a seamless buying experience. It is super easy to transfer all the items on my weekly list to cart, the fulfillment and wallet options always meet my needs and the whole buying process takes only a couple of minutes out of my day. Even when I forget something, Albertsons has me covered because of how flexible it is to add to my in progress order. Customer journey Mina is at a soccer game with her son and needs to plan for dinner for her family as well as groceries for the week. She does not have the time to do a full, in store grocery run. Mina opens her Albertsons app and builds a cart from her in store usuals, recipes, etc. She can quickly reconcile her list with her cart and be confident that she has everything she needs and trusts all her available deals are applied. And when she s in checkout, the fulfillment and desired wallet options are laid out so seamlessly and securely, that she checks out with ease using her saved credit card and easily applies her cash back rewards with a single tap. She is confident in her purchase and is clear on her delivery pickup details. After the game, her son requests snacks for him and his friends. No worries, Mina can edit her in progress order easily and get everything she needs in time without needing to stop at the store on the way home. Size of the Prize: 154M 3 year for checkout simplification wallet impact In Q2, 2.5M customers created carts online but went in store to shop. Through a simple, frictionless purchasing journey, converting .5 of these in store only customers into omni shoppers whom we know spend 19 more week or 1K year, we ll bank an additional 50M incremental revenue year. In addition, we will reduce cart abandonment for online shoppers currently 30 abandon their cart . If we re able to move our edit penetration from 11 to 15 , we ll add approximately 8M in incremental revenue per year. Financial Projection In Millions FY23 FY24 FY25 Incremental Sales 35M 58M 61M Incremental EBITDA 3.15M 5.22M 5.49M OpEx 0.5M 0.51M 0.53M CapEx 1.54M 1.58M 1.63M Success Metrics Forecasted Actuals Conversion rate 5 FY23 2.45 In store eCom penetration .5 10M HHIDs of order edits 15 4 11 Incremental order edit revenue 8M 2.6M 5.4M Non functional requirements Looking at our customers who have an intent to shop with us online, which was 2.9M HH in Q2, 68 of them complete a transaction, our opportunity lies in streamlining checkout for that remaining 30 that abandoned cart or checkout. In addition, when we look at the 56 of HH that are creating a cart but ultimately shopping in store, making the current cumbersome 10 step process smooth enough to go through could encourage our customers to shop online. Order editing has decreased from 18 to now 11 . Enhancing this experience to allow the flexibility to edit in progress shopped right now orders enables our customers to add more, which today is an average 12 per order Enhancement inputs through Division, Customer, NPS Feedback and research inputs ",

After the GO LIVE, the Albertsons homepage will look completely different from the rest of the site. Customer experience on the website will be negatively impacted as product cards will look different on different pages. Business Problem Statement CPG partners cannot use the new banners created on the Homepage on other pages through the site. CPG revenue for 2022 will be negatively impacted. All new placements on other pages on the site will have to be replaced within a few months or delayed until the whole site is restructured as per new design The tech teams will have to maintain two different versions of all webpages until the whole site is integrated into a the new design theme. This would be additional overhead. Business Outcome Hypothesis: UMA App Parity Support CPG Goals Advertise OWN brands Improved customer experience Support Market place and Food Authority and other strategic initiatives that are following new design theme and colors Pillar OKR Alignment and KPIs Improved customer experience Increased AOV Additional CPG revenue Increased business revenue for OWN brands Scope: Re skin the following pages on ALL ABS banner sites on web Aisle and category pages Search pages PDP pages Pharmacy pages J4U and loyalty pages Other landing pages Cart and Checkout pages.

Customers will be afforded the convenience of shopping, and in subsequent phases will be able to take advantage of discounts based on basket size of digital bundle. For all Albertsons customers across all banners who are shopping for items that could be bundled together the Digital Bundles initiative is a way for them to get frictionless shopping experience that communicates any items that have digital bundles unlike our current process which does NOT our solution allows them to get related products as a curated digital bundle. Business Outcomes 22M upside to 45M is easily visible by amplifying with supplier and merchandising support to drive many occasions, including Meals OKRS Enable digital bundles features for x SKUs to realize business outcome above. Non functional Requirements Tech Requirements: All APIs that are built modified need to have backward compatibility Deployment has to occur simultaneously for web and mobile UMA and legacy Ability to deploy digital bundles feature in a phased manner by category or other classification is required. Functional Requirements As a customer, I expect a frictionless shopping journey. When I embark upon my shopping journey, some of my expectations are: Less time spent on adding items to my cart this will occur when I have to click once to add multiple items to the cart that are grouped together. Ability to leverage all the deals coupons promotions within that group of items To enable the above expectations, several features need to be built both from the backend and from the front end UX perspective. This initiative needs to be deployed for the web, mobile UMA and legacy . Customer facing Requirements web : Customer is presented with pre curated digital bundles that are made up of individual items that customers typically buy together e.g. pizza, wings, chips The Product Display Page has to accommodate the display of all items in the bundle first as a group of items, and then the customer should be able to click on each individual item to see the individual item characteristics. Digital bundles presented to the customer have the following attributes on the PDP page, when clicked on each individual item: Price Image Availability Promos Deals Coupons When there are multiple items in the digital bundle and 1 or more of the individual items in the bundle are OOS, the customer should still be able add the bundle with the available items to the cart. The price for the bundle should get adjusted based on the items that are actually available for e.g. if the price of the b Customer facing Requirements mobile UMA and legacy app : Enable items with similar characteristics to be grouped together this will be enabled on the front end with the work done by the Catalog Operations team on the Catalog UI tool Customer is presented with pre curated digital bundles that are made up of individual items that customers typically buy together e.g. pizza, wings, chips The Product Display Page has to accommodate the display of all items in the bundle first as a group of items, and then the customer should be able to click on each individual item to see the individual item characteristics.

The price for the bundle should get adjusted based on the items that are actually available adjust pricing based on items that are available versus OOS . Catalog UI Requirements Ability to create digital bundles by grouping BPNs together based on similar characteristics Ability to create a shell group called Digital Bundle via the Catalog UI tool. This digital bundle should have the ability to add multiple items within itself for e.g. a digital bundle for Super Bowl could contain 3 items pizza, beer and wings Ability to add and remove items within a group. This addition should be reflected on the website in near real time When customer has a bundle in their cart and there was a change in the bundle, this change should be detected during checkout. If a bundle was changed after checkout, then there should be no impact to the customer order for fulfillment. Feature List Solution Details Customer sketches, user flows, and design mockups attached to this epic Epic Type Enabler epic type it falls under, or if Business epic Dependencies: Team Feature Catalog Refer to catalog UI requirements above to see impact. Backend API and DB changes could be potentially in scope. Fulfillment Need to understand Fulfillment impact what would be a single line item in the past, would now be coming through to the fulfillment team as multiple products since customer chose a digital bundle. Mobile Replicate web features in alignment with mobile offering for UMA and legacy app. Cart Checkout Cart Checkout need to understand the impact if the customer changes a bundle in the cart to a non bundle item and vice versa. There may be impact to order acknowledgement email and the format. UX Design customer experience UX for both web and mobile UMA and legacy OMS OMS will be impacted since multiple items will now be added as a single line item, potentially. This part will become clear during architecture review. Search and Browse Ability for searching bundles. Ability to show bundles if an item that is part of a bundle is searched. BloomReach Impact to BR feed needs to be assessed. Will the bundle offering be sent separately, will there be an impact to the format etc. will be questions that can be answered during architecture review.

Also, any kind of restrictions on account of geography, timing, quantities, delivery is conveyed to me clearly and as soon as possible in the journey. This epic is expected to mitigate customer pain points during the journey for purchasing restricted items and items that have limitations due to the following sections marked A and B : A.

      "description": " KPIs: 250k Live SKUs 1 conversion rate for every 10k new selection 1 Challenge Opportunity There is currently a 65 step process to get a new seller live on Marketplace. With several pre checks, and back and forth excel files around approved skus, categories, and brand spelling normalization, the ability to quickly onboard new sellers and ingest new skus is not possible. Besides the back and forth process, a 131 attribute template must be completed where only 16 fields are required. This requires the seller to comb through fragmented pre approved sku lists, and then complete steps for attributes such as product taxonomy and tax codes. Once this template is completed, verified and imported by the Marketplace team not the seller , additional outsourced touchpoints are required to review catalog integration layers and vetting rejections. If this process isn t automated and brought to scale, we will be unable to launch our projected 38 sellers and 320k skus by the end of 2023, further detail seen here https: jira.safeway.com smalh06 safeway com Documents Documents Sellers Seller 20strategy 2023 . We will begin to have a backup of sellers to launch due to the timing to complete all manual steps. This will in turn lead to less skus and sellers than our competitors, as well as low seller engagement, product newness, and market readiness. Example Features: Frictionless seller selection onboarding Robust API connects with integrators like M connect, Channel Advisor etc. Deduping logic Seller imports all available skus into Marketplacer and Marketplacer decides which skus are approved Automate analytics tagging Tagging for Adobe Analytics automatically associated to each new seller vs 2 sprints of set up and testing Sample Seller journey As the 1 distributor of Asian food, I am on 25 Marketplaces and get new skus from my suppliers everyday. My total assortment has 55,000 skus, and I get about 50 new everyday. Ease in onboarding new skus is extremely important to me and marketplaces that allow me to do so have more skus live than other sellers, and always have the latest and greatest new items. What makes onboarding easy for me is consistency across information and marketplaces, as well as self sufficiency in being able to complete all tasks within a marketplaces interface API . I tend to be more engaged by working autonomously and managing my listings directly through Marketplacer. If I can import all new skus I receive from my suppliers and there is no back and forth with the marketplaces account team having to remove skus for a seller already selling it or their first party business already selling it , and all required fields easily map to an attribute already in my system, then I am able to quickly onboard new skus. Where I usually come across issues is a lack of consistency across marketplaces when it comes to taxonomy and tax codes. The marketplaces that work the best for me are one s where I can supply them with my internal taxonomy and they have algorithms that map it to theirs, as well as take that taxonomy to apply a tax code. If I must go sku by sku for each of these fields, I can only do 1k skus a week vs thousands if I can use my own attribution.",

This feature gives ACI customers access to durable goods from top brands in adjacent categories with high average order value , including Kitchen, Home goods and Electronics accesories example: air flyers . Sellers who are on channel manager platforms like CommerceHub Rithum do not want to have to manage their digital store on another marketplace interface. As such, these sellers are hesitant to onboard onto ACI Marketplace limiting our selection for customers. By integrating into and supporting a channel advisor like CommerceHub, Marketplace will be able to onboard more sellers and have access to more SKUs: In this asset we will build API links to allow Sellers to Manage product selection, inventory, pricing, fulfillment, and returns refunds through preferred third party channel managers like Commerce Hub. 2.

Improve number of assets process per hour by 20 . Baseline ADAM Image Ingestion Workflows followed by 10 improvement in FY Q3 Q4. Build robust dashboard to view important stats and vitals about assets, coverage details, metadata, source etc. Empower Business users with better and efficient features and content richness. ADAM stands for Albertson s Digital asset Manager. This is an existing Adobe tool that is used by ACI teams as their central repository for all digital assits with ACI. It houses various integration with teams like Catalog, Offer Mangement and OrderAhead. It is also used by various team to house creative files, company logos, etc. This platform was launched 3 years ago keeping in mind the needs of the users then. Over the last 3 years this platform has grown and so have the users. It has become a hub for digital assets. With chanding time, there is a need to re platform this tool to cater to latest usecases. With the required re platform and expansions, our tool will be able to 1. Manage transfer of assets from internal and external users 2. Improved SLA 3. Improved Perfomance 4. Monitoring and reporting 5. Improved Meta Data 6. ADAM Meta data into EDM Ease of use: We want our internal and external customers to reap the benefits of this tool with not just basic image upload functionality but also added benefits like product tagging, search etc. This will excite our users to use ADAM beyond its core features. We want to improve our collaboration with our 3rd party vendors external customers by giving them the opportunity to accept and share digital assets with ease. Today our process is cumbersome and can deter vendors from being effective. Centralized Asset Management: We re connecting all our digital asset tools and workflows into one system ADAM for better organization and control. Streamlining Asset Flow: We re building a service to easily exchange images with our vendors and agencies, making it faster to get their assets into our system and delivery on Web and Mobile App. Supercharged Search Personalization: We ll use detailed information metadata about the assets to improve search results and personalize campaigns for our users. Moving Assets Efficiently: We re migrating assets from another system division assets third party systems and building tools to automate this process using Azure.

As part of this partnership, we provide daily, automated feed of our catalog, so that our assortment is properly displayed on their platform. Daily catalog feed contains store level assortment for ecomm non ecomm stores. As part of catalog feed, we provide two files: Item data i.e. Assortment and Promo file i.e. pricing promo info. see attached sample files. OSPI ITEM CSTORES.csv Item, OSPI PROMO CSTORES.csv Pricing promo For ecomm stores, we use Albertsons 1 st party catalog as baseline and for all allowed available items UPCs BPNs, we extract other attributes and create item and promo file. For non ecomm stores, we use 3 week look back logic of POS transaction logs for the list of items sold and then to extract other attributes to curate the assortment. Once the catalog files are created, we upload those files to SFTP sites for our partners to consume. Since same files are provided to all our partners, we do not have flexibility to customize the assortment, pricing and markup. To avoid this and give us more operational flexibility, we want to create custom catalog feeds to each our partners. Catalog Requirements for DoorDash: Data source: For ecomm enabled stores, extract the data from Catalog Runtime DB Non Ecomm: extract POS transaction Logs with the ability to customize look back period 21days, 7 days, 1day, etc Attributes columns : Extract the item product attributes from Runtime DB.

A specific item that is grouped with related options to form one distinguishable product set is known as a product variant. Product variants have unique identifiers https: www.datafeedwatch.com blog brand mpn gtin product identifiers for google shopping ga 2.195359081.419123941.1576224844 634939040.1576224844 , such as price, and every variant is based on the same product definition. For all Albertsons customers across all banners who are shopping for items that may have variants the Product Variants initiative is a way for them to get frictionless shopping experience that communicates any items that have variants unlike our current process which does NOT our solution allows them to get all the product variants in one page, thereby increasing customer satisfaction, and reducing lost sales. Business Outcomes 10M upside in conversion due to increase in AOV. OKRS Enable product variant features for x SKUs to Non functional Requirements Tech Requirements: All APIs that are built modified need to have backward compatibility Deployment has to occur simultaneously for web and mobile UMA and legacy Ability to deploy product variants feature in a phased manner by category or other classification is required. Functional Requirements As a customer, I expect a frictionless shopping journey. When I embark upon my shopping journey, some of my expectations are: Less time spent on adding items to my cart Less time searching for items with different flavors sizes Less confusion with all my coupons promotions deals for similar items in one place. To enable the above expectations, several features need to be built both from the backend and from the front end UX perspective. This initiative needs to be deployed for the web, mobile UMA and legacy . Customer facing Requirements web : Enable items with similar characteristics to be grouped together this will be enabled on the front end with the work done by the Catalog Operations team on the Catalog UI tool Similar items grouped together should be searchable Variants will need to have associated deals coupons available as part of the variant offering in PDP Ability to nominate a variant as primary variant. This decision should be made based on highest sales within a group of items if vanilla ice cream is the bestseller, vanilla ice cream should be the primary variant. This variant will also be need to be replaced by another variant when primary variant is OOS. For e.g. if vanilla ice cream is OOS, nominate strawberry ice cream as the primary variant. Retain the vanilla ice cream as a regular product variant not primary and show that as OOS. Every individual variant should be accompanied with a swatch image that should display additional details when the customer hovers over the swatch image. Every variant should have inventory availability associated with it for e.g. strawberry ice cream can be OOS, whereas the ability to display actual counts or inventory availability for other flavors should be available. A category should have the variant feature implemented for 2 attributes: for e.g. size and flavor . Different categories may have different attributes that make up a variant: for e.g. in frozen category, implement If product variants within a variant group have different prices, those prices should be available on the PDP.

Multiple BPNs items can be added to a variant group. BPNs can be removed from a variant group. Removing a variant from the variant group will make that item a stand alone item. All additions removals of items from a variant group should be reflected on the website in near real time. Ability to group variants by Banner Division ROG Store. Ability to nominate an item as a primary variant manually unclear if we are able to systematically do this work. If we are not able to do this systematically, this feature should be made available. In any case, this feature is a must have so that human intervention can do a manual override in case the system nominates a variant incorrectly . Ability to change the primary variant manually same rationale as above. Programmatic check to ensure that one variant belongs only to one variant group. Catalog user should not be able to add one variant to more than one variant group.

      "description": " Background: Albertsons works with multiple grocery delivery platforms Instacart, DoorDash, Uber , allowing customers to purchase groceries on their marketplace and have them delivered. As part of this partnership, we provide daily, automated feed of our catalog, so that our assortment is properly displayed on their platforms. Daily catalog feed contains store level assortment for ecomm non ecomm stores. Daily catalog feed contains two files: Item i.e., assortment item details and Promo i.e., Pricing promo info. see attached sample files. OSPI ITEM CSTORES.csv Item, OSPI PROMO CSTORES.csv Pricing promo For ecomm stores, we use Albertsons 1 st party catalog config database of all available based on Data Science store availability prediction items as baseline, and for these items we extract various product attributes from SSIMS and create item and promo files. For non ecomm stores, we use 3 week look back of POS transaction logs for the list of items sold and then extract product attributes for these items to create item and promo files. These item promo files are created at the store level and consolidated at the division level These item and promo files for each division are uploaded to corresponding SFTP sites for our partners to consume. Since same files are provided to all our partners, we do not have flexibility to customize the assortment, product attributes, pricing, and markup. To avoid this and give us more operational flexibility, we want to create custom catalog feeds to each our partners. Catalog Requirements for Uber: Data source: For ecomm enabled stores, extract the data from Catalog Runtime DB Note: We are analyzing the pros and cons of using Catalog Runtime DB as baseline for 3P catalog and we will switch over to DCAT Runtime DB after the analysis is complete. Non Ecomm: extract POS transaction Logs with the ability to customize look back period 21days, 7 days, 1day, etc Attributes columns : Extract the item product attributes from Runtime DB. See existing sample feed for columns attributes. 3PM Catalog Columns SampleData.xlsx Note: For the attributes are not present in 1P, we will continue to extract them from SSIMS data in EDM Remove unused columns : ABS SUPPLIER NUM, ABS UNIT OF MEASURE, ABS PRICE AS CODE, ABS SUBCAT NM, ABS REG RETAIL QTY Note: For now, we will not remove any unused columns attributes New Additional columns : BPN, Brand Name need a mechanism to distinguish Albertsons own brand items from National brands , Department, Group, Category, Class, Subclass, SubSubClass, Sales Rank , Wellness Tags, Avg weight, Purchase Qty Limit where applicable , CRV Volume Based Alcohol Taxes where applicable e.g. stores in WA, IL , Image URLs, Availability inventory Signal Note : We will review the final list with Uber and Add Delete Modify attributes list as needed. For each new attribute to be added, we will create a separate story. Ex: For adding BPN to Door Dash catalog, we will use https: jira.safeway.com browse DCAT 1829 Markup : Need ability to customize markup per partner especially for Alcohol items where partners are not allowed to markup on their own because of regulatory constraints Exclusions Blocks: Need to exclude category of items e.g. Tobacco, Alcohol, Bulk Bakery, Floral, Greeting cards to meet business, operational and regulatory requirements. These exclusions will be managed via Blocked Item List specific to Door Dash h4. New Additional columns : BPN, Brand Name need a mechanism to distinguish Albertsons own brand items from National brands , Department, Group, Category, Class, Subclass, SubSubClass, Sales Rank , Wellness Tags, Avg weight, Purchase Qty Limit where applicable , CRV Volume Based Alcohol Taxes where applicable e.g. stores in WA, IL , Image URLs, Availability inventory Signal Note : We will review the final list with Uber and Add Delete Modify attributes list as needed Markup : Need ability to customize markup per partner especially for Alcohol items where partners are not allowed to markup on their own because of regulatory constraints Exclusions: Need to exclude category of items e.g. Tobacco, Alcohol, Bulk Bakery, Floral, Greeting cards to meet business, operational and regulatory requirments.",

As a busy working mom, I can t be hunting the aisles of my local Safeway and reading all the labels to see if Jell O has come out with a new flavor. That s why I love my Safeway app and I am obsessed with their new Marketplace. Safeway has made it easy for me to be the best mom ever. My son, is always the first kid to try the latest Jell O flavors, because Safeway makes it easy for me to find it, purchase it, and eat it. I can go to the Safeway app, go to the buy it again carousel, and click on Jell O. All the Jell O flavors are on one page, it tells me which flavors I have previously purchased, and there is a badge letting me know if any flavors are new to Safeway. Not only has Safeway made the discovery of Jell O easy for me, but my purchasing decision can also be based on what s most important to me, quality and price. Safeway s product page allows me to choose the seller to ship my product who can offer me the best deal, but also by reading their reviews allow me to have peace of mind that my son s Jell O isn t near its expiration date. Their amazing seller reviews, allow me to know if this seller can be trusted.

      "description": " Challenge Opportunity Owned Brands current product offering limitations stem from space constraints within an Albertsons store. They are unable to offer their products in multiple sizes, including larger packs, as they will not fit or there is not room on the store shelves. With Owned Brands strong margins, ability to offer savings in larger sizes due to price flexibility, and brand loyalty to brands like O Organics and Signature, launching Owned Brand products on Marketplace will help stand up that one stop shop vision. It will give Albertsons the ability to offer larger sizes online, as well as the ability to reduce a customers store presence by one, ie they no longer need to shop a Costco or Sam s Club. Example Features: Catalog ingestion Owned Brands product data at a case pack level ingested into Marketplacer, ie image, description, attribution, pricing, inventory etc Finance fulfillment set up Process, ship, fulfill, and financially report Owned Brand sales through all reporting channels Contextual Display Less product heavy more operational lift Sample Customer journey Mary and her husband Jim are busy working parents. With two children ranging in ages from 1 to 4, they have a busy household and have limited time to cook, let alone shop for food and supplies. Mary loves DUG and its ability to do her shopping from the comfort of her own home. While adding emergency diapers to her cart as she hasn t had time to go to Costco, she notices the Signature Brand now offers the diapers, wipes, and formula that she purchases when she is in a pinch in larger sizes. Mary has always been a fan of the Signature brand, but a pack of 24 doesn t cut it in her family. That s why monthly Mary goes to Costco to buy that 200 pack of diapers and wipes. But thanks to this new expanded selection of product on the Safeway Marketplace, Mary can spend more time with her family as that special trip to Costco is no longer needed, Safeway s Marketplace has truly become a one stop shop for Mary and her family.

Customers want a trusted one stop shop where they can find every item on their list and have the flexibility of getting them when and how they want at a reasonable fulfillment price. This EPIC will enable the following: 1. Extend reach to 65 of ACI customers shopping on digital 57 of all customers shop using Search 8 shop directly from browse pages. By hybridizing the walled garden to show all relevant products regardless of sellers fulfillment method, we can drive visibility across search and browse pages 2. Address an unmet need in the industry for both our existing and new customers Up to 16 of segments say shopping is difficult due to needing to shop multiple stores to get everything, and up to 20 say it s difficult to find specialty items or ingredients. Our MLP follows the Instacart model where customers shopping their list product intent must enter and exit out of each seller storefront seller intent to find items. We can create a unique experience in the market where customers can look for and find every item on their list in the same place without the extra steps, AND allow them to deep dive into shopping seller specific items 3. Unified checkout, fees, and flexibility Online transactions are stressful, asking customers to transact carts one by one on a Marketplace with a wealth of sellers will become increasingly unscalable Etsy has moved over to the unified cart experience Sample Features: Unified search and browse: Find products regardless of seller banner 3P included in 1P category aisles Improved customer navigation: Allow both product intent shopping trips and seller intent shopping trips Unified checkout: Flexibility for customers to check out everything in cart at once, or parts of cart Sample Customer Journey: Ann is a second generation Cantonese immigrant and loves recreating dishes from her childhood. During Thanksgiving, she watched her Mom closely and wrote down the 20 ingredients needed for the Taro Chicken recipe. She wants to recreate this meal for her husband and 2 kids. During her weekly online trip, she logs into Safeway.com and starts searching for items one by one, starting with XiaoXing cooking wine. She sees a couple of results returned, one for local delivery from Ranch99, and one from Elite Commerce via shipping. To save dollars from multiple delivery fees, she adds the cooking wine from Elite Commerce for Shipping since it s free and she won t need it until next week. Curious what Elite Commerce is, she clicks through to their storefront and realizes they carry so many Chinese items she s unfamiliar with and bookmarks the page for later exploration. Ann is focused on her task at hand and is pleasantly surprised she found all 20 items so quickly previously she would ve spent hours going store to store With the time savings, Ann pokes around site to see if she can find little delights to reward her two kids for behaving so well at stressful holiday get togethers. She navigates to the Cookies, Snacks, and Candy department. Here, she finds not only the Swedish Fish her kids love bringing to school every day, but the specific White Rabbit candy her grandmother used to bring whenever she visited from Hong Kong. Delighted to introduce her kids to her own childhood snacks, she adds the White Rabbit candy from Saywee to her cart. She goes to her cart and sees the fresh produce from Safeway she usually orders for pickup, as well as the items ready to ship directly to her door from Elite Commerce and Saywee, all with clear ETAs indicating they ll be ready well before next Sunday s meal prep. She s presented with a Checkout button next to each grouping Pickup, Shipping , so she knows that she can place the Shipping order now and spend more time to review her Pickup order if she wanted to. Available to her as well is Checkout All button on the cart for all orders confident she has everything she needs arriving at the right time, she clicks Checkout All . She then selects a time slot for tomorrow at 6PM so she can swing by Safeway after work to pick up the fresh items. She is also able to confirm one more time that the Saywee and Elite Commerce shipments will arrive on Friday. She confirms the CVV on her credit card and places the order, excited to introduce both a traditional meal and childhood snacks to her family next week. ",

As part of this partnership, we provide daily, automated feed of our catalog, so that our assortment is properly displayed on their platform. Daily catalog feed contains store level assortment for ecomm non ecomm stores. As part of catalog feed, we provide two files: Item data i.e. Assortment and Promo file i.e. pricing promo info. see attached sample files. OSPI ITEM CSTORES.csv Item, OSPI PROMO CSTORES.csv Pricing promo For ecomm stores, we use Albertsons 1 st party catalog as baseline and for all allowed available items UPCs BPNs, we extract other attributes and create item and promo file. For non ecomm stores, we use 3 week look back logic of POS transaction logs for the list of items sold and then to extract other attributes to curate the assortment. Once the catalog files are created, we upload those files to SFTP sites for our partners to consume. Since same files are provided to all our partners, we do not have flexibility to customize the assortment, pricing and markup. To avoid this and give us more operational flexibility, we want to create custom catalog feeds to each our partners. Catalog Requirements for Instacart: Data source: For ecomm enabled stores, extract the data from Catalog Runtime DB Non Ecomm: extract POS transaction Logs with the ability to customize look back period 21days, 7 days, 1day, etc O Organics Division: For Instacart only, we need to send ITEM PROMO files for a special division O Organics Division that contains just O Organics brand items for select group of stores. Attributes columns : Extract the item product attributes from Runtime DB.

Limits us in enabling and scaling shipping As an example, when a customer selects to shop In Store or Pickup, we have no way of knowing the customers home address until the checkout page, to validate if we can, when we can, and how much it would cost to ship specific items to them. Today we have highly convoluted negative paths to address the potential mismatch in shopping zip code and customer addresses Shipping cannot currently serve a customer that doesn t live near a Delivery enabled store 2. Prevents us from unlocking extended fresh frozen local delivery partners such as Market Wagon and Sayweee Our MLP overrides existing architecture today to be shown on all 3 channels and overrides the existing Delivery channel for transaction and fulfillment by indicating it s a Marketplace item. Our systems will not be able to differentiate between local delivery and shipping in the future without clear delineation This prevents us from onboarding frozen fresh products not carried in our stores today and aligns with the 1P opportunity of expanding the frozen and fresh categories of Pet, Baby, and Ethnic Foods 3. Creates significant customer friction and lowers product visibility While pickup and delivery are mutually exclusive shopping intents, shipping should be incremental to a digital store based trip i.e.. my groceries delivered, and the specific KitchenAid mixer shipped from the warehouse since it s not available in store . Setting up shipping as a channel will enable flexibility in showing relevant products with fulfillment method clarity, promise dates sensitive to warehouse x customer location, and flexibility for shipping speeds similar to how customers can select same day next day flash delivery slots Example Features: Local delivery sellers ability to onboard 3rd party sellers fulfilling through local delivery AND shipping if applicable , this opens the fresh and frozen categories Item level ETA item specific ETA from different warehouses to drive consideration and conversion Shop by fulfillment intent allow customer to search and browse Delivery, Shipping, or Pickup similar to Target Walmart Product card fulfillment clear delineation on product cards of how an item can be fulfilled Add to cart intent flexibility for customers to select how they d like it fulfilled Faster shipping options nested options i.e. ground expedited next day shipping Shipping returns shipping specific return flows and fraud engine Sample Customer Journey: Evan is the father of 5 and pays a little more to have his weekly groceries delivered through the Safeway app since it s easier to curate everyone s wish list, faster than spending 2 hours at the store, and less cumbersome to not have to drive to the store and bring back 20 bags each week. He usually shops on the app without designating how he will get the item this way he can see all the products in one place that can be hand delivered on the same day, and the less urgent items such as bulk and specialty items that can be shipped through Marketplace with no fee He realizes they re almost out of rice and could use a fresh bag. He searches for the 10 pound bag of Sekka Premium Japanese rice he knows Natural Commerce carries and can ship directly to his door. Right from the search page, he finds it and adds it to his cart. He enters a search query for the next item on his list Oi Ocha Green Tea for his boys. He sees right on the product cards within the search results that the single bottle can be delivered through Safeway tomorrow, or he can order the 12 pack shipped or delivered to his door from Saywee. He clicks on the Oi Ocha Green Tea PDP and sees the two different CTAs: Deliver It Earliest 5PM today , and Ship It Next Day Shipping arrives Friday, Dec 1 Ground Shipping Arrives Tuesday, Dec 5 He sees that the fastest shipment method would arrive 3 days from now. He s usually a better planner than this, but he s running behind as his son caught the flu, and needs all his groceries by tomorrow. Since he s pressed on time, he decides to pay a little more for double delivery one from Safeway and one from Saywee, so he can make dinner for his little ones tomorrow. He clicks deliver it on the Green Tea PDP. Realizing the urgency, he unselects shipping from his shopping mode so he can see what is available to arrive today or tomorrow. Since he already started a Saywee delivery cart, he decides to also add Azuki Mochi, and the social media famous Tiger Sugar Boba Milk Ice Cream to cart it s been a rough week . From there, he continues down the rest of his list on Delivery mode and adds each item to his cart. In cart, he reviews all the items grouped by Delivery from Safeway , Delivery from Saywee and Shipped Items and clicks checkout all . He selects the earliest 5PM slot for both Safeway and Saywee so he can leave to pickup his son at soccer practice by 7PM. He also see s that the shipped items will all get here in 3 5 days. With everything looking good, he places the order.",

      "description": "Starting 1 1 2023, a bill in Colorado took effect which provided an option of removing taxes on essential hygiene products. Counties, districts and cities have the option to apply all or part of the tax exemptions. In SSIMS, all four tax buckets are already being used. To charge the appropriate tax rates at the correct level county, district, city additional tax buckets are required. Due to existing tax bucket limitation in SSIMS, there is a projected 30,000 uncollected tax for every period. The definition of each bucket is really just tax rate 1 , etc. the business doesn t know what will be legislated that will require use of the buckets ... generally it could be called as special tax rates For instance, In July 2022, the State of Illinois waived its portion of the low rate for Grocery Items. Albertson s Companies must reduce the rate in HOST Tax Bucket A by 1 for Grocery Items. The Tax Team can t utilize the current 4 HOST Tax Buckets for the new rate. Therefore, additional Tax Buckets are required for Albertson s Companies to be in compliance. In August 2022, the State of Colorado just passed a Sales Tax Exemption on Essential Hygiene Products. Counties and Cities have the option to opt in or out by December 31, 2022. If they decide to follow the State, additional Tax Buckets are required as well. In addition to the states of Illinois Colorado, the following states potentially will pass the new rate unexpectedly anytime: Arizona, Louisiana, and Virginia. At this moment, the Tax Team only has a workaround for the state of Illinois. Without additional tax buckets for other states, the Albertsons Companies will have to pay the uncollected sales tax out of pocket. Request: The request is to add 12 more tax buckets initially 4 tax buckets in the Host POS, for a total of 8 tax buckets, to match the 8 tax buckets that POS can already handle. Benefits: Help The Albertson s Companies avoid potential fines and penalties for not being compliant IL State Tax Rate because the end customer is supposed to pay this tax. Help the Albertson s Companies to avoid doing accrual on the uncollected tax and pay it out of pocket which is currently estimated between 59,000 and 77,000 each month. Prevent Albertson s Companies get into the potential legal issue for appearing to have a competitive edge by having a lower tax rate on the receipt vs our competitors. IT Impact Analysis: 4 SSIMS tax tables are expected to be updated with additional fields. Any program that uses these tables will need to be recompiled and tested regression , even if there are no code changes to the program. For those programs that will need to be updated, application owners have been asked to provide estimates on the development and testing effort. In addition, if these updated tables sends information to EDM Teradata, EDM TD processes will also need to be evaluated to ensure additional data is also sent to EDM and consumers of the EDM data can also be sent consume these new information.

Streamline commerce information simplify governance and management of product information to enable faster time to market, satisfying customer experiences and greater productivity. It would also reduce cost and increase performance for the end users. Business Value: To reduce the cost and overhead, ITEM360 will deliver all attributes in a linear fashion by joining one time logic with several tables to put the details into a flat table. Not only cost, but this will increase the performance by at least anticipated percentage TBD . Nonetheless, this For larger product and merchandising program, this ITEM360 will play a key role by supporting the need for item relevant data in a most efficient and optimized way.

      "description": "United Supermarkets was acquired by Albertsons 10 years ago in 2013. At the time of purchase, United s banners included United Supermarkets, United Express c stores , Amigos and the innovative Market Street format. Following acquisition of the core 20 stores, the United division was expanded materially to include stores from Albertsons Southwest and Southern divisions providing a consolidated presence in West Texas and New Mexico and expanding their banners to include Albertsons and Albertsons Market. United is by far the dominant local brand in these areas and consistently drives innovations which are scaled across Albertsons. United completed over 54M transactions in FY22, yet their data is not visible or considered in: 1 Shopper switching and brand preference models which fuel Merchandising decision making 2 Investor talking points related to the number and growth of HH we serve 3 Critical retention and customer lifetime value modeling and tracking to drive our Ambition of Customers for Life Part A: Build Product hierarchy out of active UPC into a new table in EDM Part B: Provision to update partial information and create an OVERRIDE file to load into the same EDM table. Override information to get precedence over original IRI inbound file While doing so 1. We need to retain original value 2. Add modified value in a seperate column 3. Add a new column as Source and populate it with OVERRIDE for modified line item 4. Audit column to capture date time stamp for OVERRIDE ingestion 5. An Exception table to cover edge cases and negative scenario did I capture right Probably require a bit more details later Questionnaire to be filled out by business and IT: 1. Who has permission to update the file and how we can capture the user and timestamp details: We ll need to work out who the long term owner s would be, Stephanie R. can be that person for now. 2. How frequently this override will occur: The override will be in place indefinitely, how often it is updated appended will vary based on how often new stuff comes in. Really difficult to say at this point 3. What level of modification on an average possible be how many rows or columns : So far business identified three points for modification one and two is an entire family item code United term is classified as one sub class move all of a into b , third is at the upc level where we d assign a upc to a specific subsubclass 4, What is the process of adding hierarchy for new item given the fact it takes 6 wks for IRI to provide us the product hierarchy which might cause a understated reporting: Business recommend we d map it manually when it comes in and then when the IRI hierarchy adds the item we cross check if the override is still needed.

      "description": " Background Safeway banner was approved as a retailer for the USDA s pilot program SNAP EBT Online Purchasing in 2018. In practice, this means offering SNAP EBT and EBT Cash as a digital payment type. For several reasons we attempted but did not succeed in standing SNAP up as a payment type until 2020. The project is divided into two phases. Phase 1 SNAP DUG: This is intended as an interim solution until phase 2. The customer orders groceries online, and select a participating DUG store the customer offering SNAP as a payment tender. The transaction is suspended no payment taken at Place Order and the DUG associate takes payment at the DUG pickup spot using a mobile POS. Phase 2 : full integration with the Acculynk, the USDA s official payment provider to provide full digital payment experience for the customer. This epic focuses on Phase 2, SNAP as a Digital Payment Type SNAP EBT and EBT Cash will be offered as a payment type across all channels: desktop web mobile web tablet and App Only banners with a FNS awarded by USDA , and the banner store is turned on for EBT may offer SNAP EBT and or EBT Cash as payment types Banner must be paired with Host State and pass a two week stabilization period. If no major issues as defined by FNS incurred during stabilization period, the banner may proceed with full deployment of remaining stores within the banner If a SNAP DUG store is migrating to SNAP EBT and or EBT Cash as payment types system will remove SNAP DUG payment type as a payment type for that banner store System must enforce USDA requirements if customer paying with SNAP EBT funds Slot management : Delivery and DUG dates may not exceed seven days from day of placing order If a customer chooses SNAP EBT at checkout the system must recalculate checkout to: Restrict SNAP from paying all fees e.g., bag, subscriptions, etc. SNAP eligible items payed with SNAP are exempt from paying taxes Non government container fees e.g., vendor 2 deposit on milk bottle, etc. Any weighted items must apply the Weight Debit of 10 additional to the weighted price on order for each item s Order Summary must present the SNAP summary and non SNAP summary Each time a customer re allocates and updates dollar amounts applied against SNAP EBT the system must recalculate the order totals New payment method added to Account Payment Methods Customer may add SNAP EBT card at checkout Customer has option to save EBT card during checkout Saved EBT cards are added to the Account Payment Methods on customer s account Placing an order at checkout using SNAP and or EBT Cash Checkout must accept multiple payment types SNAP EBT, EBT Cash and CC and or Debit Card Customer may select combination of EBT only, credit debit card only, or combination of EBT Credit Card If customer selects EBT system will validate with Acculynk card is valid and which account types are active SNAP EBT and or EBT Cash before EBT is enabled as payment type System must allow customer to perform funds balance check on SNAP EBT and EBT Cash accounts System must allow customer to allocate specific dollar amounts to apply for SNAP and or EBT Cash Place Order CTA becomes active when customer allocates funds owed for the order to each available payment method After customer taps Place Order the system secure funds from each payment type If CC debit card chosen as a payment type system will attempt a full authorization on funds specified If SNAP EBT and or EBT Cash chosen as payment type s customer is re directed to Acculynk to perform PIN transaction for each payment type to secure funds Redirect customer to Acculynk site to perform PIN based transactions Fulfillment requirements from SNAP USDA if items paid with SNAP EBT : System must not charge higher price for substituted items System must refund overage charges on weighted items System must not charge more for weighted item whose total exceeds the price of the total of item weight debit Refunds to SNAP EBT require using new PINless Refund Functionality Customer initiated refund request Order Cancellations, Order Edits, Self Service Refunds Customer Service ECHO refunds OMS VPOS post pick refunds for Weight Debit refunds and Out of Stock Delivery and or DUG refusals refunds Online items refunded at the store Customer refunds must occur within 2 days of activity Customer must receive notification of refund event. Data points included: Date of transaction Time of transaction if included for other customers Transaction Type Truncated SNAP and or EBT Cash Account Number Transaction Amount Remaining SNAP Balance if applicable Remaining Cash Balance if applicable Order Confirmation Email for SNAP EBT payment type orders must include following: Banner Date of transaction Time of transaction if included for other customers Transaction Type Truncated SNAP and or EBT Cash Account Number Transaction Amount Remaining SNAP Balance Remaining Cash Balance For purchases only: Delivery pickup shipping address Actual or estimated delivery pickup shipping date Actual or estimated delivery pickup time if appropriate Itemized fees for delivery pickup shipping, ordering, convenience, handling or other fees or charges Itemized fees for bags or other delivery pickup shipping containers 8. Order Edit . As a retailer for SNAP we are required to offer SNAP customer post Order Edits if the rest of the customer population is offered this service. Order Edit must include ability to update edit an order and can pay using SNAP and or EBT cash as a tender type 9. Discoverability and Awareness of SNAP. As a retailer I need to ensure we have mechanisms for our customers to search and find out which delivery zip codes and DUG pickup stores are accepting SNAP EBT and EBT Cash as a payment type so that our SNAP customers may use this payment option Update to store finder to include search parameter to include SNAP Online as a search parameter Update eComm services to that system can include SNAP EBT on a store",

Goals Capture actions and events from various systems e.g., Health App, Grocery purchases, Dacadoo, Pharmacy that can be used to create business rules for the issuing of Healthy Points. Build an in house earnings model that will give Business stakeholders the ability to configure and manage incentives, using event logic from various systems, that will results in points earning opportunities Allow business users to test or segment certain activities to a subset of users to allow us to 1 test and learn before presenting an earning opportunities to all users and 2 configure earning opportunities that are based on user cohort or segment. Establish and implement logic for points expiration h2. Background and strategic fit For the United MLP, we leveraged Dacadoo s earnings model which allowed the Customer Engagement team to establish how many points are awarded per category e.g., lifestyle, mind, body, and surprise , how many times i.e., slots points are awarded for a specific subcategory and the percentage of points across each category relative to a max points budget. Beyond MLP we want to ensure opportunities to earn points and be rewarded are inclusive of our customers, their lifestyles, health goals and their interactions with ACI as a whole, not just the Health Platform. h2. Assumptions To earn Healthy Points, user must have the Health App downloaded and a Health Pharmacy account created Requires a Grocery Loyalty account. Users will be able to view, claim and clip coupons from the Rewards pages of the Health app. Users can still earn points for completing goals, tracking activities and completing surprise actions as defined in the Dacadoo earnings model.

For example: Pepsi comes to ABS and they say they want to target any consumer who bought Pepsi products in the last six months and offer a 1.00 offer to just those consumers. This is where it would be considered a household targeting. We would have to pull the data and then Show that offer to those people who qualified. With Quotient, we shared the data where when a user would sign up logins and API would be called giving information to Quotient on the user but with Neptune we do not share any kind of user information.

Today, B4U Offers are being picked up from the Digital Asset Management System ADAM as High Res Images, but the Web Pages are down grading those images as they reach the customer in Web. While the image in it s smallest form doesn t highlight the lack of quality, as the image size is increased there is a noticeable difference. In order to implement High Res Images in the Coupon Cards, we need to review the current design in order to take full advantage by displaying larger images, similar to how UMA leverages them today. Goal: Update how our B4U Offer Images are rendering to the end user by reconfiguring how offers display. Insure the highest quality images possible. Review Coupon Card design and increase the size of Product Images at they appears in all Offer Formats on Web and insure a consistent look feel through the various Offer Cards. Impacted Offer Cards For U , My List , PDP , Offer Details Adjust how For U Logos are displayed next to Offer Value on Coupon Cards. Review how Coupons Deals are displayed in Carousals.

Success Metrics: Increased email channel engagement metrics within six months of launch. Decreased email opt out rates within six months of launch. Impacted Teams: Web Team, UCA, UX, EDM, COMMS Goals: Create functionality for customers to explicitly indicate their content preferences, such as dietary, product category, or holiday themed content. These content preferences would live separately from communications preferences i.e. Offers Promotions and would be optional to customers to capture incremental data about them. Use Content Preference Data points to target customers for marketing campaigns, journeys, as well as personalize content. Use Cases: Allowing customers to opt out of Mother s Day or Father s Day marketing campaigns. Allowing customers to opt out of Pet Care or Baby Care content in their emails.",

The disparate style guides from the migrations will now be consolidated into a single, standardized UI specification from ABSCO UX, and the components will undergo remediation to align to these new standard specs. This should help facilitate greater interchangeability of components and resolve some of the css issues, as well as incorporating Accessibility and Darkmode support.
