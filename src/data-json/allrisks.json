In current system, receiving corrections are identified in the APPO table in the field SEQ PAYMENT and the corrections update in all corresponding WIMS screens with accurate accounting. LCM AP Validation screen does not have a proper solution for this currently. Additionally, this creates an inaccurate data set in LCM.

This is a schedule risk for P3 as OCS may be asked to design a fully custom solution to match 3rd party freight invoices to PO estimates if the POC proves unsuccessful.

In the member demographics segment of Wade s contract, the following text has been included in the DMG04 value which is the location for the marital status code. ORA HRX SEP HMSA does not require that a marital status code be sent on the file for members but the above value is not an acceptable value. Once this value has been removed from the DMG04 segment, then the member should pass without issue. Thank you, Andrew Kist Lead Customer Success Specialist, Customer Operations",

Not a setup identified in production as of 11 01 2024. AND the store has an association with a CF facility for store delivery AND the patient receives a new eScript which is on CF formulary AND the patient and or dispense meet all other CF eligibility criteria Issue actual result: Since no logic exists in current state to choose a pickup type, a delivery pickup types cannot be chosen and the system fails over to assigning the CF pickup type despite their documented preference. Expected result: The system defaults to a defined delivery pickup type depending on patient CF preference. That way it stays local if CF is disallowed and lands in shipping queue OR goes to CF and lands in shipping queue upon arrival. Workaround: Ensure that only 1 delivery pickup type is active for a CF store. Stores maintain lists of patients to check WC or similar existing operational workaround. Business impact: For R 1: Likely in parity with existing Autofill pain points. Beyond R 1: Moderate risk of customer service failures for stores with a large delivery preference demographic.

Printing CF vial labels in states other than ID and or WA Issue actual result: The prescribed product may or may not represent the actual prescribed product recorded in EPS. And vial labels print the prescribed product below the dispensed product without regard to dispense specific conditions. There have been instances of a generic being typed as the prescribed product in EPS with the brand name printing on the NX vial label. Expected result: Vial labels should print the prescribed product only in certain situations as documented in PRD printing of value conditional. Workaround: No known operational workaround to yield expected result. Hotfix pushed which changes the verbiage of the label from Substituted for: to Generic for: until defect fixed. The opinion driving this interim fix was to align the verbiage to represent a comparison agnostic of user system logic when brand name value prints. Business impact: For R 1: Likely minimal, WA and ID have no requirements concerning this field Beyond R 1: Unknown. Some states require specific label verbiage to be used. Some states may require that this field truly represent the actual prescribed drug when a generic substitution is made. Root cause: NEXiA existing implementation with SBMO does not include conditional logic in handling this field. If received in POX, the value always prints. No other customer has requested this. Contributing factors: No requirements workshopping between cross functional product and engineering teams. AC not provided or reviewed before testing in ACI env. No comprehensive demo or iA testing outputs provided to PM for review. Potential resolution s : NEXiA meets reqs rules as documented in PRD iA aligns the logic to existing EPS logic and implements a fix in NEXiA. Pending evaluation by iA dev team.

This is common request from frequent travelers, caretakers that need to divide the medication across locations children in school, split custody, nursing situations Issue actual result: EPS vial label prints with an expiration date reflective of the date the vial label was reprinted from EPS. Expected result: EPS vial label prints following EPS logic to select the date printed. In cases where a date was entered in NEXiA for product s used during the fill task AND a specific date from that dataset is expected to print on a vial label in EPS IF had the fill task been completed locally, then the label should print a date consistent with EPS local vial logic. Workaround: No known operational workaround to yield expected result. For handling known error: When a request for a duplicate vial label comes, the pharmacy staff may reprint a label, review the lot information in the fulflliment tab of the Tx details, and use professional judgment to manually strikethrough the existing date and write in a modified date if needed.

Potential operational scenario s : More than one patient at the same store has same similar name and those patients get prescriptions filled through CF fulfillment. Issue actual result: The package label on the outer packaging has minimal patient identifying information. The patient name will print without a unique identifier like address. This is an issue when the packaging is not made of a transparent material and may result in packages being opened for the wrong patient. Expected result: The package label will need to include a unique identifier ie patient address . Workaround: In store team members should follow known mark as sold SOPs and be prepared to handle edge case scenarios requiring opened CF packages to be repacked. Alternative until implemented, open bags upon receipt and place contents into Monaco bag. Business impact: For R 1: Unknown. POS systems have blocks in place to prevent sale of incorrect dispense to patient. Beyond R 1: Unknown. Expansion to higher volume inherently increases the chances of user error when POS SOP do not prevent a failure mode. Root cause: Requirement gap. Contributing factors: RCA to be completed post go live to identify process improvements and mitigate risk of missed requirements.

We should increase network engineering and support focus in this area and quickly move on to the action items that you listed. Please let me know what you need from EngOps. I would also request you to send this report on a weekly basis going forward. Maximum throughput in Azure ECX and GCP has doubled for May, with spikes of 5Gb outbound to Azure on 5 10, 5 15 and 5 19 between 8AM and noon, corresponding to the same spikes in GCP ECX in San Jose Region. Utilization in Ashburn remains low. Note that although we have 10Gb on GCP ECX, the fabric for GCP is set to 5Gb which means we were maxing out the virtual link with those spikes. The ECX we have for Azure is 10Gb but is comprised of multiple sub interfaces and we do not have throughput data for each sub interface. Legacy Expressroute is set to 5Gb, Non Prod to 5Gb, and New Prod is set to 10Gb which is shared on the 10Gb Link. These throughput spikes also maxed out San Jose backbone router 1 Te0 0 0 10 11 Bundle Ethernet2 which is the link between RTBB and the Cloud Router Trusted Firewall since traffic between Azure and GCP hairpins on the RTBB Bundle Eth2 to the firewall. These spikes likely would have affected other traffic between RTBB and the Trusted Firewall. I have included a diagram on the spreadsheet. Outside of the spikes, average throughput has also increased but remains within threshold.",

After extensive deliberation, we ve decided to discontinue the use of this problematic tool PCM for MFT setups, effective immediately. Going forward, all new setups will be implemented using the Sterling File Gateway SFG . We re in the process of developing a new framework, which will necessitate a brief development period. As a result, there will be a temporary hold on current MFT setups. Here are the specifics regarding these delays: SFTP Setups not involving Azure Blob: Pause of 1 week MFTs involving Azure Blob: Pause of 2 weeks GCP Setups: Pause of 3 weeks 2 weeks for non production development, 1 week for production development We value your patience as we navigate this inconvenience.

We would like to understand the scenarios, how the configs are overridden. Scenario1: Why are configs overridden from your restart Is it just restarted, or you have done changes in etc systemd system grafana agent.service by changing ExecStart from bin bash appl grafana agent grafana agent.sh to bin bash appl grafana grafana agent.sh and then restarted manually Scenario2: Ansible script is checking whether Grafana agent exists or not and it is working but we are having suspect whether the ansible script is overriding the alloy path in etc systemd system grafana agent.service that is from grafana agent path ExecStart bin bash appl grafana agent grafana agent.sh to grafana alloy path ExecStart bin bash appl grafana grafana agent.sh irrespective of whether grafana agent already exists or not. In this case, we don t see any immediate effect but if any restart occurs, it will change to new agent river config . If the script is falling under scenario2 then we need to exclude all PROD VMs with Grafana agent exist from your script execution PFA the email shared already with VMs list or you need to modify the ansible script to avoid updating in to etc systemd system grafana agent.service incase of grafana agent exist.

Custom knowledge article user groups have been created so that we can segregate articles to specific groups eg: ACI KB Retail Associates, ACI KB Retail Managers, ACI KB Manila Managers, ACI KB Manila Associates, ACI KB VT Only, etc., etc. . Knowledge articles are linked to the custom user groups, and if the article has an attachment, the user will not be able to open view the attachment. They would still be able to view article content, but cannot open any attachments that are part of the knowledge article. Oracle has confirmed this is a known issue attachment access using a custom user group and they need to get back to us on when a resolution fix would be available. Our Manila Associate population is the most impacted, since many of their HR knowledge articles have attachments. We would have to redirect user to SharePoint site to get the attachment. Potential is there to just continue using SharePoint site for knowledge articles instead of Oracle knowledge base. Less impact to our US Associate population.

I ve attached the Visio of the Lucid Chart I was reviewing. We agreed today: The implementation should be direct integration between LMS and IAM to facilitate the removal and restoration of user access via AD Group Membership o Sam and JP will collaborate to frame the integration properly and we will review next week after Wednesday o For revocation, we will expect LMS to run a nightly process to determine which users to revoke and trigger user account property changes in IAM. IAM will apply policy in near real time to remove revoked users from the affected AD Groups. o For restoration, we need Sam and JP to determine an effective means to update IAM via account property change within 5 10 minutes of a revoked user completing their required training, so IAM can restore group membership. LMS should be responsible for all communications and management escalations regarding training deadlines JP indicated the implementation should target the new LMS platform, migration due to complete end of October 2021. Please add correct any of my statements. Flordeliza Liza, I m confident JP and Sam and team can produce the needed integration. Do you want to schedule the follow up for Thursday next week to review Thanks, Harry Little Pharmacy Technology Team c 925 260 4505 Original Appointment From: Harry Little Sent: Tuesday, August 3, 2021 5:50 PM To: Harry Little JP Verma Sambuddha Ghosh Cc: Syed Rayadurg Anup Tomar Charu Saxena Subject: Review Target Flows for EPS Access Restriction via LMS When: Thursday, August 5, 2021 10:00 AM 10:30 AM UTC 08:00 Pacific Time US Canada .

This affects the backfeed to PeopleSoft and means we need an alternate to our atom feed integration to manage hire date changes for existing work assignments. The product team is evaluating possibilities for the roadmap. In the meantime, we can see two possible options. Create a new integration leveraging a BIP to meet this need. Our team would be happy to advise on approach. Manage hire date changes through the call center. There is already a ticket type for this type of change. Given the tight integration between ORC and HR, it is anticipated the need for exceptional changes like this will likely be lower than current state. We know timing is very short for a change of this nature. Please let me know if it would be helpful to arrange for a call between our teams to discuss.",

Those employee are pulled off the merit file and not processed. That list of employees is sent back to the Compensation team. For when an employee returns from leave, and should then get the increase, I m not involved in that part of the process. HR would do the pay increase either through self service or send to HR Data to do the increase once they return. Future state Process : TBC 1.

For LOA, we will allow the information to flow to EE assignment in Core HR from Compensation module. If any EE hasn t worked for extended period of time years and is on LOA, Compensation team will mark their merit as 0. Action Item Althia to discuss with Michael P ensure that he addresses with Elena. b. For any EE terminated , Action Item: Karthik will check and confirm how Cloud HCM system handles this scenario. c.

If Merit is less than what an EE makes increase due to pay rate change, promotion, etc. , those merit changes will not flow to EE assignment record and will be reported in an Error report.

Finance calculates the achievement numbers for corporate, division, store, manufacturing and supply chain bonus plans in excel spreadsheets and maps the payout and sends it to Compensation. In some circumstances, finance provides the achievement numbers to compensation in excel format and compensation derives the payout before using it in the bonus plan calculation. The request is to build an integration from Oracle Finance to HCM where the finance data is extracted, transformed, mapped to the various payout curves for each plan type Corporate, Division, Manufacturing, Distribution and Store and then loaded into User Defined tables so that the compensation plans can reference the payout values in the user defined tables for bonus calculation purposes. There is also a sales qualifier that impacts the bonus Payout the logic for how the qualifier impacts the payouts also needs to be built into this integration. The user defined tables will already be put in place for Wave 1 and the interface will need to update the values in the table on a quarterly basis.",

If the decision is to make changes to FSLA status needs to occur in PS. The additional unplanned work will impact the current Wave 1 timing for delivering the Coexistence 001 functionality. Team meeting scheduled for 4 30 21 to discuss where the data changes will occur in PS or HCM.

So you are aware, in the current state the business performs mass upload tasks in PeopleSoft. accountid:5f5a8f8f10d187006f3da240 is working with accountid:5ac794c5ee170837b7c417f3 accountid:5f868eed9dbd090069b39712 to ensure that azure servers are set up for active directory to enable users to do this when PeopleSoft cuts over to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI at the end of May. The bottom line is that I do not believe we will have to change our mass upload process for HCM Wave 1 after we implement the solution for OCI in May but I want to make sure that accountid:6023b54f692da10070ee2cfe has accounted for this in the set of coexistence requirements FDD and we are testing accordingly because it s painful if we don t find out until later . Please let me know if you have any questions thanks.",

This is NOT going to impact the infrastructure which PeopleSoft is currently residing on. This is for HCM only. Need to evaluate this against the Environment management plan and then de escalate.",

Typically clerks, meat, and pharmacy even though in same Union will have very different rules. There are locals with same code. Local 1546 is in both UFCW as well as International Assoc. of Machinists. but here it is two separate locals happen to have same number. Future State: a Bargaining Unit can be tied to only one union. In the future state it is decided to keep bargaining unit codes unique to Unions by prefixing union code to existing bargaining unit codes. Example: New BU code for Local 1546 in Union 001 will be 0011546 New BU code for Local 1546 in Union 006 will be 0061546. No Changes will be made to existing PS system.

      "description": "In PS today there is a custom process that brings forward all assignment information to any future rows when a retro dated transaction is entered. For example, if an employee goes through a transfer on 1 1 2021, then a location change on 2 1 2021, and then a retro change is entered in on 1 1 2021, all information from that retro transaction should flow forward and replace the information within the 2 1 2021 transaction. We need to replicate this type of process in Cloud in future state. We will need this capability for Self service transactions. any updates done by Joanne s team can be managed manually by them. We need to ensure that any changes to the position gets applied to future dated transaction related to the position as well in an automated manner. accountid:5ef67a374d302e0ac3268b48 accountid:5f6e03f6ad3484006aa0008c please update the description if it needs anything else.",

      "description": "Current: Certain contracts that are based on hours worked require the progressions to be effective on the date the employee becomes eligible. Since Payroll hours become available a week later, all the updates are retroactive. Therefore, a manual process is done in current state to identify the day of the week an employee meets the hours to progress to the next step and then update the assignment record using that effective date. Both Hours and Effective date, Step entry date are currently updated to keep everything in sync. Future The Grade Ladders can be defined to progress employees on the eligibility date. However, this will continue to be a retroactive update since the hours worked aren t factored in until a week later. Since the hours worked would not be supplied on a daily basis to determine the exact day of meeting the eligibility criteria, a manual process will need to be continued to ensure the progressions take effect on the correct effective date. Effective date, Step entry date will be updated in Cloud and then it will flow to Peoplesoft. However, hours worked will not be able to be adjusted as hours are calculated correctly but they are just late. This may be revisited in Wave 2. So what: I need to understand the manual workaround to ensure progressions take effect on the correct date.",

The only way to figure out what an employee s prior SSN s was is by running a query against an audit table. This query tracks only SSN changes if the employee ID did not change. The query has some quirks and takes some analysis to determine the correct history. The employee s whose employee number changes along with the SSN are not included the old SSN is on the record with ACTION TER, ACTION REASON DID . Would it be possible to include SSN and or Employee ID changes in the employee history on Oracle This would make tracking and reporting these employees so much easier. We should build SSN change history for active and term d employees. Need to start with history for the current year plus the prior year.

Once a store terminates an employee the Personnel Coordinator retrieves the cover letter from the email sent from PeopleSoft to use for sending the file to record retention. If an employee is terminated by the division office HR team, they send the email received from PeopleSoft to the respective personnel file owner for processing. If someone is in need of a missing cover letter it is pulled directly from PeopleSoft. We have not experienced a need for generating multiple cover letters at a time. From: accountid:5f868f279dbd090069b398be Subject: RE: Require additional information for Project Optimus HCM Transformation project related to MS Access Database Hello TJ: I ll respond for Norcal. Catie mailto:Catie.Zavala safeway.com , please disregard. For cover letters, we use the peoplesoft link to create the coversheet for scanning. However, if we have a large number of files to scan happens quite often we use the access database that Darrell is referencing. It allows us to create the sheets faster than one by one in peoplesoft. This access database is not linked to peoplesoft or any type of feed. It s a simple query pulled from peoplesoft data to load to the database. It includes terms and active employees in order to allow us to make coversheets for any current or former employee. These databases were in place Safeway pre merger and should be the same across most divisions unless the division has updated changed them. NORCAL TERMS PROMPT is a query we use in Norcal to pull the fields needed to update the access database for terminated employees. For OBW, my understanding before I went on maternity LOA the last week of Dec may have changed now is that we would be looking at potentially a solution in wave 2 for the documents that we coversheet and send in to be scanned to content manager. But in the meantime, we would have access in Wave 1 to deep links to the coversheet creation in peoplesoft and be able to pull a query of data from HCM Core data after Wave 1 go live if we needed to update our databases. Please let me know if I can answer anything else or provide any other data. From: accountid:5f868eef6932330076516e4c Sent: Tuesday, February 16, 2021 4:10 PM Subject: RE: Require additional information for Project Optimus HCM Transformation project related to MS Access Database Hello, In the current process, ALL employees require a cover letter for Content Mgr Navigator entries. The options are all available through drop down boxes in Psoft. We have not used a database for multiples, but rather do them one by one directly using Direct2HR. The updated process makes it much faster than it used to be. That said, would appreciate an option for multiples. It should also be noted that not all Supply Chain facilities are using Content Mgr for their personnel files. Several teams are still keeping paper files. Those of us using it have our own systems. At the Denver DC, we send in term files and keep paper files in house. When a single employee file starts to become too full, we pull it and get it off to imaging. In other DCs, they only send term files and yet others scan in two years worth of content at a time. Please advise if additional info is needed. Thanks ",

As part of the requirement for KB, we will need 1. Way to categorize these policies Identified one Category and 4 Sub Category for now 2. In order to create a governance process for policy documents, we will need a way to set up approval flow for specific enterprise wide policy docs. 3.

It will be a large change management piece informing the Divisions that everyone needs to worklist job data changes in the same manner. Also AEC is currently retraining all the divisions on how to customize their set up to allow each division to worklist MSS self service items by HR the way they prefer.

      "description": "Currently OLC has a course start and end date. The course start date makes the course active and the course end date make the course in active. In our business we release new courses that are target for new learners. Typically due to payroll constraints we do not make an existing associate complete the new course. This process forces us to create a new course audience instead of using the existing position audience. For example a new course on produce freshness would not be assigned to the 10,000 existing produce associates but would be assigned to new learners. To implement this request we would need to create new audience for the Produce freshness assigned to all produce clerks with a start date after 11.13.20 Impact Without this feature will cause excessive use of payroll and assignment training that is not necessary. Or, will increase the number of audiences by 2 to 3x. Solution A course effective date would override the position audience date if used and would only assign it to new learners after the effective date. accountid:5c585ca195f91f3a04204623 accountid:5a67a91e2eed6b2d0236e0d5 accountid:5a67a9189089ba71829fce28 accountid:5a67a91a4e6fa32306362384 accountid:5f7f140ae31b69006fdf014e ",

From: Weiwei Yap Weiwei.Yap albertsons.com Sent: Wednesday, October 28, 2020 4:22 PM To: Mackie, Alex alexandermackie KPMG.com Cc: Angela Villaceran Angela.Villaceran albertsons.com Subject: EXTERNAL HCM Learning: Pending Hired Worker Hi Alex, A topic came up during Recruiting validation workshop, regarding converting pending to hired worker only on Day 1 when worker shows up. KPMG s advice to this is to alleviate some pain points today relating to onboarding for recruiters, eg. if worker was hired but never showed up. Will this affect Learning, especially if courses are already assigned for example Are courses assigned prior to or after hired Thanks, Weiwei Hey Weiwei, This is a good question. We should connect with recruiting to review employee data as they are transferred from a pending to active employee. This will allow us to determine the most efficient way to assign new hire training Some thoughts: If the employee has a Person ID as a pending worker, we can still assign training Would it make sense to try applying an assignment rule to this employee status field So that when an employee switches from pending to active, they would be assigned required new hire training. Something that would require testing, and we would want to connect with recruiting to confirm this field. I m creating a JIRA ticket to further track this conversation. I know we are deep in validation workshops right now, but when things calm down we shoot probably meet on this topic.

If the timing of Fieldglass going live is not clear yet, we can focus on building the integration between SNOW and HCM Cloud for wave 1, and when Fieldglass goes live, we just need to ensure that it is able to generate an output feed of contingent workers in the same format similar to what will be produced by SNOW, thereby avoiding a need to change anything on the Cloud HCM OIC side. In either case, having the requirement functional spec finalized by 3 8 will help in meeting the development timelines for CRP2.",

Currently Albertsons Careers Website is just a search site for jobs it does not hold any sort of applicant data. If a candidate decides to apply for a job, he she is routed to ADP RM to start the application process. ADP RM publishes an XML that contains all active job requisitions including the URL that points directly to the job requisition on the ADP RM site on a scheduled basis this is what the Albertsons Careers Website and the other third party search sites that the company has business with consume to keep the data current.

To mitigate this risk, please contact me or Sandip Kakani no later than EOD on10 31 20 to inform us that you require an ODBC connection to support your business operations. Just so you are aware, the HR IT team has SOME visibility into what is happening with ODBC connections in Naini Mandala s AEC, but we have ZERO visibility on what is happening at the division level or out in the field so this risk is especially pertinent for you . AEC teammates please review update the attached spreadsheet. We will automatically assume anything not accessed in 2020 will BE GOING AWAY IN MAY 2021.

The customer is concerned about why non production changes were made without a change request. Due to this escalation, the APM team has to schedule non prod change requests to secure official sign off from the impacted application teams. We learned that the Azure Streaming solution is already available for Azure Metrics BLOB SQL Exporter. Therefore, instead of upgrading those exporters, Azure Streaming needs to be enabled in Non PROD as well. This was not done by the Ingestion team in the last PIs, despite the Product team communicating the critical priority of Azure Streaming solution implementation in PI3 PI4.

Upon investigation it was found to replicate on other clusters as well. On Shared clusters, the issue seemed to stem after the cluster upgrade activities. A restart of the metrics collector component was done the values reported on the metrics were back to expected. On PHI cluster, the values were seen to have fixed after disabling clustering for the cadvisor component. This is a change from the planned configurations for the metrics collector upgrade. Hence the planned changes were placed on hold. As a background check the values of clustering enablement match the values from what are referred from Grafana repository. A ticket has been raised to Grafana team for seeking assistance on this deviation in behavior.",

Platform team deleted POD to have Loki OSS back on the track. This issue was related to capacity problem in the no prod environment . Discussed with senthil and below solutions were identified to resolve the above issue : 1. Increase the ingested pod in loki OSS for couple hours to increase the capacity and we can scale down the pods after the testing. 2.Reduce the log volume as this is in no prod environment. We will have obtain approval from Hari s team Integration Services to remove the older logs . 3. Just send the logs to cloud saas .But this will not be the same config that we will be implementing in prod. 4.Test the position file which implies the markup of logs that are already read by the agent.This has to be tested. We plan to go forward with item 1 2 and need your approval for the scaling up of ingesters that involves increase in cost.",

The ESOB platform has limited capacities and have a requirement for App teams to submit Intake Forms. This process allows us to ensure the Observability Platform has sufficient capacity and allows us to allocate resources to support the onboarding process. Cost impact Shared 02 in prod currently running with 13 nodes and we are expecting approximately 8 to 13 nodes added due to this changes. Assuming the higher end 13 additional nodes of standard sku will cost 13 750 9750 for each month without considering enterprise discount. Mitigation Plan Teams to follow the onboarding protocol. To mitigate the issue, below is the plan: Following is the plan for addressing the current issues with the Tempo enablement for EPE and other teams. 1 Deploy Tempo with baselined configuration with 5 percent scaling which can support upto 150K spans second which can support their load without any problem 5 8 2 Upgrade Tempo and move Tempo to shard05 cluster ETA 5 30 a. Upgrade tempo to 2.4.x has TraceQL performance improvements and better caching b. Shared02 we are seeing some issues within cluster and being it is small cluster with Ingestion pods are in it would be good to move to shared05 this requires DNS switch to common url and possibly 30 1 hour outage. 3 Change to trace ingestion AKS monitoring solution ETA 5 10 if feasible This will further reduce volume of traces ingested and provides more stable backend a. Tail sampling changes b. Drop traces based on app code so that we can enforce onboarding process We might need to prioritize this activities with all groups of ESOB. ",

The BRD indicates these integrations are available and ready to consume. This does not seem to be the case with significant amount of build, test work that ABS may have to undertake. For short term 90 days , using Grafana Universal Alert Manager will support and suffice for low volumes. But as soon as the volumes of logs and metrics increase, over next few months, robust existing integrations with Teams, SNOW, and other channels will need to be available to maintain to the program milestones timelines.

Mitigation Plan : 1 Based on current prod volume assessment expected data from 50K queues generate 4M active series , one pod can handle the ingestion. 2 Worst case scenario: In case volume from MQ is increased, pod may fail and restart every 5hours in ESOB. Queue related data 2 metrics will not be ingested into ESOB and will not be available on Grafana for FaR expectation set to FaR team . 3 Discussed with platform team and confirmed platform can handle this volume and incase pod fails due to high volume and restarts, it will not impact the ESOB platform. Next Step : We can proceed with exporter deployment in ESOBF prod, need to keep a watch on MQ volume and pod health until regex filter change is implemented. Note: Deployment is only on ESOB nodes, no deployment on MQ side. MQ team is ok with us to move forward with deployment, their Nastel API is available in prod. added Himanshu as approver in the CR .",

However, per chat with Dave, he doesn t have bandwidth to support at this deeper level. Details about logs being pushed into log analytics log structures, field mapping Keywords or strings to search in the log for MQ MIM IIB metrics and status errors trace monitoring DB MySQL structure and access to understand file transfer status, error messages etc. List of metrics to be monitored for these systems Mitigation plan: To be discussed. For IIB, we got another contact from JP, we setup a meeting with him tomorrow For now, for MQ MIM we will analyze the logs provided to us and get some understanding. 2 Need to assess if this is a risk MIM stores file transfer details in logs and detailed status error messages in MySQL DB. However there is no secondary for this DB, its standalone with no replication enabled. Dave is unsure if there is secondary DB setup, he will check with offshore and get back to us. Querying detailed metrics from SQL DB may lead to DB performance issues and deadlock, so per discussion with JP we will explore the data available in log analytics and design feasible dashboards.",

Currently the team is also occupied with other priority initiatives. 8 Jan: Until these dependencies are cleared we couldn t start the development of this, BRD finalization: Jeff is still working on finalizing the BRD, the scope is still not confirmed whether we are going only with Command Control or including Self healing and Monitoring. 2. Access Privilege for the EIOT system account: Sandhya Sandala Contractor is working with Cindy and George for linux and Hugo for Window 3. Design approach Edge based vs Cloud based : We initially proposed edge based approach, but JP wants to keep the option open for cloud based as well. For Cloud based, we need to open the firewall from AKS subnet to all the RISE stack servers. We had few challenges in getting the Firewall approval earlier for other use cases from Infosec, anyways we will create new RIT for this and check. We are having challenge in getting the IP ranges for this, Akshay K Sangma Contractor would check with Sergio and create the needed RITs. Below are the pros and cons of both approaches Edge Based D Server Cloud Based AKS Overview Edge based remote command capability by having our IoT agent running on each stores D server. From EIOT platform we can perform the remote operations thru this IoT agent which in turn executes the command inside store network. Pods running in AKS, directly connects SSH or WinRM to each of the RISE stack servers for Command Control Request Periodic Monitoring Possible by having the IoT agent to check the status of each servers on the Stores every 30 or 60min once. Periodic monitoring of 25K servers from few Pods will have scalability issues Availability Remote command and control is performed through D server, if D server not available for any reason, the solution looses its capability. AKS is highly available. Performance High Performance possible as the commands are distributed to the each store edge agent Less effective Scalability Solution can scale for the increasing number of servers to be controlled Not scalable ",

This impacts the planned deployment of Link Negotiation usecase. Current Plan of Action: ESOB to plan for performing this analysis by stopping the exporter in prod. If the exporter is found to be the culprit, do we plan to do optimization on the consumption. The timeline it would take. If optimization is not possible, alternate option Meraki said they cannot increase rate limit. We cannot move further on this use case without addressing this API rate limit issue. ",

Checking on the CHG and ETA 6 Mar: Call scheduled with InfoSec and Network team at 10:30 PM IST today 3 Mar: BCC InfoSec Team as it looks to be more of asynchronous routing issue rather than proxy related. Dan found this and will be working on the change. To set expectations, please note that routing change is a normal type of change so the solution will most probably be for next week. 2 Mar: Network Support team enabled the Firewall, yet the portal was not accessible.

This lack of experience within the pod can lead to various challenges and potential setbacks to PI 3 Activities. Potential Impact: Delayed Onboarding: New team members require additional time to adapt to the pod s practices and expectations, potentially delaying PI tasks and milestones. Reduced Productivity: Initially, new members may be less productive as they get acclimated to the pod, impacting the overall team s efficiency. Mitigation Strategies: Comprehensive Onboarding: Implementing structured onboarding process for new pod members, including orientation sessions, access to relevant documentations, systems, and introductions to key team members. Mentorship: Assign experienced pod members as mentors to new team members, providing guidance and support as they integrate into the pod. Regular Check Ins: Conducting regular meetings to gauge the progress and comfort level of new team members within the pod. Training and Skill Development: Offering KT sessions focused on the pod s activities processes and tools to expedite the learning curve. ",

We cannot ask for System Id s as our application is using Dataflow jobs which will use GCP Service Users which are IAM users in the cloud and we do not have fixed Linux Windows users to use. Rajeshwara Tokala Contractor mentioned that you had created a user credential for him and shared an authorization code that he could use in the REST API for his POC. Can we setup something similar as a dev user for us we can store the authorization code in the secret manager and use from the dataflow jobs at runtime. Please let me know if you need more details or if you have any questions for me. Thanks, Raj ",
